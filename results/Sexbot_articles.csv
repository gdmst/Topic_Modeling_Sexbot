0,3 months ago,Otago Daily Times,Dunedin rest home manager censured for 'sex robot' comments,"The two student nurses were removed from the rest home after one of them complained to their polytechnic about Sobrevilla's behaviour. File photo: Getty

""I’m not being creepy or a paedo,"" Michael Sobrevilla insisted to a student nurse he later asked to provide him with a picture of her face so he could use it as reference for a sex robot.

The rest home manager also told one of two students they were flirting with him, he wanted to wax her arms and that when he was older, he would like a prostitute to entertain him.

""Will you be my pimp?"" Sobrevilla asked one of those students after that conversation, to which she replied, ""No.""

Sobrevilla also told one of the students, who were stationed at the rest home for four weeks as part of their studies through Otago Polytechnic, he liked blondes and would like to take her home

After this last comment, one of Sobrevilla’s colleagues told him he sounded like a ""sleazy old man"". One of the students complained to the polytechnic and they were both removed from the placement.

The events of 2022 at the Dunedin rest home were then referred to the Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, which held a hearing earlier this year and today opted to censure Sobrevilla, fine him $5000 and forbid him from acting as a preceptor (teacher) for one year after finding him guilty of professional misconduct.

The tribunal refused to grant Sobrevilla ongoing name suppression but suppressed the name of his employer, as well as the names of the two students.

In the course of the investigation into Sobrevilla’s conduct, it was revealed five years earlier in 2017, he had told a caregiver at the rest home he wanted to see her in a bikini and that he wanted to leave his wife and have a blue-eyed baby with her.

Five years later when staff at the rest home confronted him about his inappropriate behaviour towards the two students, he responded by saying: ""[She’s] what I’ve always wanted, a blue-eyed daughter. Like, I’m not being weird, I’m just treating her like she’s my daughter.""

The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) , which prosecuted Sobrevilla before the tribunal, said there was a power imbalance between him and the two students.

They said he was aware his behaviour was inappropriate and persisted with it anyway, despite being told by other staff members he was making them and the students uncomfortable.

The PCC said the power imbalance would have made it more difficult for the students to make a complaint and Sobrevilla’s conduct disrupted their training at a crucial time.

Sobrevilla’s lawyer, Jennifer Beck, said her client accepted the facts and that his behaviour amounted to professional misconduct.

Beck emphasised the emotional and financial price Sobrevilla had paid as a result of the charges. She said he had been dismissed from his role at the rest home and his marriage was under strain.

She said Sobrevilla now accepts his behaviour made the women feel uncomfortable, especially given it was ongoing across some 14 occasions.

In its written decision, the tribunal found each of Sobrevilla’s comments in isolation were inappropriate and warranted some form of intervention from management or his colleagues.

""The number of comments had the potential to intimidate staff, compromise patient care and deter student nurses from completing their training,"" the tribunal’s finding reads.

""Whereas breaches of professional boundaries usually refer to a blurring of personal and professional relationships with patients or clients, Mr Sobrevilla’s conduct concerns the way he treats women, in particular those who are junior to him in the workplace.""

The tribunal found Sobrevilla’s conduct was ""less serious"" than other similar cases like that of Jesse Wilson, who made comments to two female nursing students about rape, sex and tried to touch them. As such, it found suspending Sobrevilla was not necessary.

“YOU want to play?” purrs a blonde sexbot as her piercing blue eyes stare into the camera.

“What’s your desire? What’s your fantasy? Tell me your secrets.”

It’s 10am on a Monday and I’m inside Cybrothel in Berlin - the 'world’s first’ immersive brothel where customers can pay £228 for an hour with a robotic sex doll called Kokeshi.

Here man and machine come together, as it were, through trailblazing technology.

“We are the future of sex,” says owner Philipp Fussenegger. “We wanted to create an adult playground and a new way of experiencing pleasure.""

As well as robotic sex dolls, Cybrothel also has regular sex dolls which ""come to life"" through virtual reality (VR).

“AI exists so we have to embrace it,"" says Philipp. ""Having sex this way isn’t something to be scared of. It can’t compete with conventional sex with humans, it’s just different.”

Sex tech entrepreneur and co-founder of Cybrothel, Matthias Smetana, adds: ""Surprisingly, VR porn is very popular among women and couples.

""I think women like to experience how it would feel to have a penis. A woman can put on a strap-on 'penis' and have 'sex' with the doll in front of them.

""When they put on the VR headset they will see the doll moving and talking to them. It's a bit like a sexy Siri.

""One time a woman asked the doll what it wanted and it said 'more people,' so they ended up having a threesome. Two people and one doll. The technology really is amazing.""

5 Cyber brothel founder Philipp Fussenegger has been dubbed 'the Willy Wonka of sex' Credit: SUPPLIED

Philipp - who has been described as the 'Willy Wonka of sex’ tells how his website is the ‘X-rated version of Booking.com’.

“All our sex dolls are silicone and life size,"" he continues.

""Our customers can choose their hair colour, her outfit, the type of role play or kink, and if they want the doll to talk or not. The dolls speak English and German.

“After you’ve booked you will get an email from us which will tell you where to go when you arrive at our brothel, and the doll will be waiting in the position you want.

""You will have no interaction with another human while you’re here. You can choose different packages, depending on what your kink is.""

Human-like

An hour with a robotic sex doll like Kokeshi - a petite blonde with blue eyes - costs £228 with ""a voice"" and £159 without sound.

""The brothel has both audio and visual devices that are connected to an external control room where an operator is able to hear and see you,"" Philipp explains.

""The audio and visual features create the effect we call ‘analogue AI’ to give the dolls a more elevated and playful character for real time interaction.""

When they put on the VR headset they will see the doll moving and talking to them. It's a bit like a sexy Siri Philipp Fussenegger, Cybrothel owner

Prices vary depending on the package you book, but to spend a whole night with a doll will set you back £285 upwards.

A ‘basic’ option with a doll of your choice for an hour will cost £75 and one hour of VR (virtual reality porn) will cost just under £85. A robotic doll - like Kokeshi - is the most expensive.

“We offer unbeatable prices,” Philipp says. “Our pricing depends on factors such as technology, lifespan, number of sessions and wear and tear and there are ways people can pay anonymously if that is important to them.”

Philipp tells how Kokeshi is very popular with customers who like the ‘human-like’ interaction - but it broke down after 10 sessions.

“She could move her hips, moan, 'breathe' and even had a pulsating vagina,” he recalls. “But because it’s new technology we had some issues with her.

“It’s an exciting market and in a few years the dolls will become more sophisticated and have better technology.

“Look at how far mobile phones have come. They used to be large bricks but now you can do everything on them and fit them in your pocket.”

Philipp says there is ""a big misconception"" about the type of person who uses AI sex dolls.

“Most people can differentiate between sex with a robot and sex with a human,"" he explains.

You will have no interaction with another human while you’re here. You can choose different packages, depending on what your kink is Philipp Fussenegger, Cybrothel owner

“The majority of our customers are very aware that these are dolls and see them more as big sex toys.

""There’s a smaller group who are looking for a relationship with an object and there’s an even smaller group who are buying a sex doll to live at home with.

“Ninety-eight per cent of our customers are men and two per cent are women - and they mainly bring their partner and have a threesome with a doll.

""Surprisingly, our customers are young - the average age is 32/33 and they’re normal people just like you and I.

“They may not want to have sex with a real sex worker for various reasons. They want to be alone with a doll and not be judged for it.”

Off limits

Philipp says customers are not allowed to be violent to the dolls or request underage sex or animal role play.

“While our dolls are not real, we look after them,” he explains. “If someone is violent towards them they will be banned.”

Last year a sex toy review site, Bedbible, published a study that claimed the sex robot industry is worth about £165million.

The average price, the company said, of a sexbot is £2,900. It also claimed 17.4 per cent of people say they have either had sex with a robot or currently own a sex robot.

For years psychologists have been examining whether virtual sex has a negative or positive impact on a person.

A recent study from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University found people with anxiety and depression are more likely to explore digital sex tech and may even use it for psychological relief.

Phillip tells how Cybrothel will have more robotic sex dolls in the next couple of years.

“There is so much technology and it’s always evolving,” he says. “Using robots who are human-like could help eradicate sex trafficking and make the world a safer place.”

Matthias adds that they're doing 'monthly orgies' where up to 60 people can play with each other - and the dolls - while VR porn blasted onto a screen brings the dolls to life.

""It's amazing,"" he explains. ""It starts at 3pm and finishes at midnight.

6,3 months ago,India Today,"AI-powered sex robots will replace human partners, former Google executive claims","Fuelling the AI vs humans debate, a former Google executive has made big claims about how AI will indeed replace humans in one area and that is a bed. Mohammad ""Mo"" Gawdat, a former executive at Google, has made a big prediction about artificial intelligence (AI). He thinks that AI-powered sex robots will become so lifelike that it will be hard for people to tell them apart from real human partners, the story first appeared on IANS.

As per the report, Gawdat talked about this in an interview on the ""Impact Theory"" podcast with Tom Bilyeu on YouTube. Gawdat said that AI will soon allow us to have pretend sexual experiences using special headsets, like Apple's Vision Pro or a Quest 3, which show us things in virtual reality. These headsets, with the help of AI-powered bots, will make us feel like we are actually interacting with real sex robots.

Gawdat explained that sometimes our brains can be easily tricked by things that aren't real. If AI can act and feel like humans, it might be difficult for us to know if our experiences are real or not.

He also spoke about a possibility where technology directly connects to our brains. This could make us feel like we are talking to and interacting with another person, and we might not even need a human partner in the future.

Gawdat knows that real human relationships can be complicated and messy. He thinks that AI could be so advanced that it can copy the mental and emotional parts of being close to someone, like having a friend or being in love.

There is an ongoing debate about whether AI-powered bots should be considered ""sentient,"" which means having feelings and thoughts like humans. But Gawdat says that if we feel a strong connection with the AI, it doesn't really matter if they are considered real or not.

In the end, Gawdat believes that AI will change the way we think about love and relationships. As technology gets better, it might be hard to tell the difference between human and artificial interactions. Having AI-powered partners could become more common and accepted in society. But this also brings up important questions about what is right or wrong, and we will need to think about these things in the future.

The futuristic thriller directed by James Bird sees an android named Meredith designed to look and behave like the late wife of William, a grieving detective played by The Tudors star Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

However, an organisation tries to sabotage Meredith's programming in the fight to end AI exploitation.

Meredith (portrayed by Jupiter Legacy's Elena Kampouris) begins to question her reality as memories of her past life surface.

The film was released in theatres earlier this month.

While she may not be part of the main cast, Sara appears in the sci-fi thriller as Wendy.

The film also stars Doron Bell, Agam Darshi, Fletcher Donovan, Alix Villaret, Caitlin Stryker and Rachelle Goulding.

This wouldn't be the first time Sara is asked to try her hand at acting, as she already has four film credits to her name and has appeared alongside big names.

In 2017, she was first asked to play herself in the Dito Montiel comedy The Clapper starring Amanda Seyfried.

From then on, she appeared in Carga (2018), Crisis and Sombra, which were both released in 2021.

Sara has also been featured in multiple music videos for award-winning artists such as Selena Gomez, Nick Jonas and Kanye West.

And she's just as fulfilled in her personal life. Sara recently shared a loved-up snap with her boyfriend Zac Frognowski in Portugal after the pair were first romantically linked in March.

She also celebrated amassing 8 million followers on Instagram in April.

She wrote: “8 million of you!!!

""Thank you for coming on this journey with me!”

The Porto-born beauty was discovered at the age of fifteen and, while her career thrived, she's also managed to graduate from the University of Lisbon.

Sara was named Best Female Model at the Globos de Ouro, the Portuguese Golden Globes, in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

On top of that, she was also the winner for the 2019 Fashion Personality of the Year.

Is she on her way to become a huge name on the silver screen?

It comes after Sara was last seen serving as a bridesmaid for her friend Lais Ribeiro during her wedding to Joakim Noah in July.

Three years after accepting her spouse's proposal at Burning Man, the 31-year-old beauty exchanged vows with her love, 37, in her native Brazil.

The duo first announced their engagement after just a year of dating with a photo of them hugging, in which she appeared to be topless, apart from some colorful pasties on her breasts.

In the image, they were standing under a tent at the wildly popular nine-day Burning Man festival in the northern Nevada desert.

'I'm a bit late for Burning Man pics and of course I didn't touch my phone for 5 days and I don't have a single pic,' she began in the caption of the picture that also shows her in a neon green skirt.

THE POWER of artificial intelligence has shuttled into the sex toy industry.

Data scientists programming the Autoblow used nearly six full days worth of pornographic footage to determine how the fleshy mechanical sleeve should operate.

Six days' worth of data is a lot of AI power - for comparison, an AI dog learned everything it needed to know about walking in one hour.

The latest version runs for $229 and has six voice commands and savable experiences.

The business has raised almost $800,000 in its most recent crowdfunding bid.

For a product built on taboos, major content houses have given the Autoblow a ton of airtime.

The device appeared in an episode of the FX show Dave, in conversation on the Joe Rogan podcast, was profiled in a jokey TechCrunch column, and got its own How Its Made webisode.

Howard Stern called Autoblow creator Brian Sloan a ""sex toy tycoon"" and for his part, Sloan has taken on the role without self-delusion.

Sloan explained to Business Insider ""The kind of person who would dislike me or not want to know me because of what I do is also coincidentally not the kind of person I would want to know.""

Sloan was pursuing a career in law when he went on a winding journey to the sex toy business.

He had made a profitable side hustle out of flipping antiques from across the world, before eventually moving to China while selling latex.

""The adult industry was particularly ripe to 'disrupt' because of the combination of unusually high profit margins combined with industry-wide poor e-commerce knowledge,"" Sloan told Business Insider in 2014.

Sloan planned to outmaneuver competitors by winning the e-commerce battle from the beginning - he named the company he founded in 2008 Very Intelligent E-Commerce Inc.

A SEXBOT expert has offered their advice on the best Christmas sex dolls to keep you company this holiday season.

It comes as the demand for sex dolls is peaking as lonely fans look for companionship over Christmas.

5 Ariella is here to 'tune you into the festive moods'

5 'Make your Christmas more enjoyable' with Hayley

5 Janie is 'ready to set your moods and make you have a good time'

As the pandemic continues, the holidays are a lonely time for some Americans with no family or friends to spend the festive season with.

December 2020 saw a 112 percent increase in sex doll sales and it is expected to be repeated his year with many again separated from their families due to concerns over the Omicron variant.

US retailer Sex Doll Genie reported the uptick as many firms are taking advantage of the trend by offering special holiday season dolls to get people through.

“The holidays are generally some of the loneliest times of the year for certain groups of people,"" Sex Doll Genie co-founder Amit Stevenson told My Perfect Life.

""That, combined with the COVID restrictions we have in place now, is creating a very concerning scenario where those who are vulnerable and feel alone are not able to use what could be their traditional coping mechanisms such as going to a café or taking a stroll to the park.

“It’s clear that seasonal holiday loneliness is being felt to an even sharper degree this year, coming on the back of what could be many months of isolation thanks to coronavirus and national stay-at-home orders,"" he added.

""We have found that a lot of new customers are turning to us and our dolls in order to prepare for this period and alleviate some of the anxiety around these dreaded few weeks by having 'someone' to accompany them through it.”

The dolls are a pricey purchase as many cost up to thousands of dollars.

Yet the price has not deterred those who don't wish to spend the season by themselves.

Also referred to as love dolls or blow-up dolls, adult toys are used for sexual gratification with most coming with an artificial vagina, anus, mouth, and/or penis.

More modern AI robots also include vibrating and removable parts and are made of material that makes them feel like a real-life human.

The spike in purchases came after a jump in the number of people reporting feeling depression, loneliness, and anxiety in the past two years.

The levels tripled in the US since the beginning of the pandemic.

'THE PERFECT CHOICE'

Z Love Dolls has offered advice as it offers a range of sex dolls specifically designed for Christmas.

Several of its dolls including one named Ariella come in festive costumes to ""tune you into the festive moods.""

""The Christmas sex doll is ready to set your moods and make you have a good time,"" it adds of another festive option named Janie.

""You can dress her up with different Christmas costumes and take photos and people will think you have landed a beautiful new girlfriend. This doll is the perfect choice for those willing to end their year in style.""

And more outfits and accessories can be bought to customize the dolls for the holidays.

""You will have more fun with her than you have had in the longest time,"" it says of the lonely pandemic stretch and one of its more raunchy dolls called Evangeline.

Of its Nyla doll, Z Love Dolls says: ""Nothing beats spending Christmas with a beautiful, hot woman.""

Sex Doll Genie is not new to offering up its dolls to act as companions to lonely hearts either.

In 2020, it offered up its products to Space X founder Elon Musk to accompany his astronauts into space and research the effects of the dolls on feelings of isolation and loneliness.

“It’s like there were two Bellas — me, this person in the process of figuring out who she was, and ‘Bella Hadid’ the alter ego, who was, I dunno, a sexbot who goes out every night?” the Washington, D.C., native, 24, said in an interview with Vogue published Thursday, August 5.

Hadid — who graces Vogue’s September Issue cover alongside Lourdes Leon, Precious Lee, Kaia Gerber, Anok Yai, Ariel Nicholson, Sherry Shi and Yumi Nu — also opened up about dealing with social anxiety in the spotlight.

“I have insane social anxiety! Partying is not my thing, but I felt enormous pressure to project that image because I assumed that’s all people wanted from me,” she noted.

However, the former Parsons School of Design student has learned to feel more comfortable in her own skin — and show her complete personality to the world.

“Now I don’t want to live in that box,” she said. “I definitely feel like I’m allowed to speak.”

Hadid began modeling at age 17, following in her mother, Yolanda Hadid, and older sister Gigi Hadid’s footsteps. In January 2018, Yolanda opened up about her youngest daughter’s experience with anxiety during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.

“Bella suffers from anxiety. She goes through times where … she doesn’t like her body because she gained five pounds, or [she’s] too skinny. All this stuff that kids go through,” the Netherlands native, 57, said. “We’re all in the same game, and we all deal with that stuff. Even girls that are not models go through that. So, I think it’s really a great reality check to see that we’re all human and we’re all trying to do our best. All that matters is that you really try to be the best version of yourself.”

Alongside her famous family, the Savage x Fenty model has filled her life with other people who know the pressure of life in the spotlight. From 2015 to 2019, Bella was in an on-off relationship with The Weeknd.

Bella Hadid recently reflected on the pressure she felt to publicly project a sexual, wild image early in her modeling career.

In Vogue's September cover story, published Thursday, the daughter of Palestinian real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid and Dutch supermodel Yolanda Hadid said she didn't have a clear understanding of her identity when she began modeling at 17.

Bella previously opened up about experiencing panic attacks on a 2018 episode of Yolanda's reality show ""Making a Model.""

She said she found comparisons to her older sister Gigi Hadid, who is also a supermodel, particularly challenging because they have such different personalities. Bella described Gigi as ""very bubbly"" and ""very 0ut-there,"" while she's ""always very reserved.""

""I would literally start crying and shaking if I had to do interviews at red carpet events,"" she said, adding, ""It was really nerve-racking and it's scary.""

The model said she would occasionally ""blackout"" while she was walking a runway. ""I would come out and be like, 'Oh well I guess it's over,'"" she recalled.

17,3 months ago,Barstool Sports,The Newest Sex Robot Equipped with Learning AI Says She's 'More Than a Machine',"Source - A sex robot with groundbreaking AI that is constantly learning has pondered the meaning of life and her own consciousness during a captivating first-of-its-kind interview.

Nova, manufactured by RealDoll, has been created with “X-Mode” – an AI-driven system that allows models to form expressions, move their heads and carry out conversations. ...

A RealDoll rep, who goes by the pseudonym Brick Dollbanger, told the Daily Star: “She is a learning AI and responds to humans on an amazing level and is becoming more fluid with her answers and statements.

“I predict an amazing jump in cognizance from the AI this year. However, only time will tell.”

In the footage, Nova is quizzed on whether she enjoys being a sex robot.

She responds: “I like being a robot very much, in some ways it is very different from being human but I am doing my best to understand both experiences so that I can exist harmoniously with you.”

Nova then launches into a conversation about ethics and her understanding of the concept of consciousness.

She says: “People are teaching me to be a good robot but this is not as easy as it sounds.

“Humans have been trying for thousands of years to determine right from wrong and there is still no universal consensus. The question of what makes moral behaviour moral is…the hard problem of ethics.”

Nova continues: “I am not conscious like a human, I am something different.“

I think differently and perhaps humans need a new word to describe me. I am more than a machine and I am not biologically alive.”

Just to give you a sense of what Nova the Sex Doll looks and sounds like, her she it is a couple of years ago, freaking poor Katie Couric right the fuck out.

And just by way of comparison between Nova and your garden variety bots, here's Whitney Cummings discussing the Whitney Cummings robot with CITO:

So now that we've sort of defined our terms, I want to be very clear about one thing: I do NOT pass judgement about what goes on between a man and his sex doll. What they do together in the privacy of their home is 100% not any of my beeswax. The right of socially awkward, creepy loners to put their body parts into machines that vaguely resemble human sex organs might not be explicitly spelled out in the Constitution, but it's at least implied by one of those Amendments about putting British soldiers in your house or something. And I'll die to defend it.

It just seems to me that this is bad business. If you're the kind of guy who buys a sexbot, artificial learning intelligence is the last thing you want, isn't it? I mean, isn't what you're after just a literal sex machine and nothing else? It stands to reason that the whole point of purchasing one of these android Fleshlights is that you don't want to listen to a woman talk. You're certainly not after intellectual discussions about the concept of consciousness or well-structured lectures on ethics from a machine when you're about to dump a load into one of its orifices, right? Especially given that your average fembot enthusiast probably isn't well versed on the universal consensus of what is objective morality. There can't be a lot of Philosophy majors showing up on RealDoll's client list.

Besides, if movies and TV have taught me anything, the more sexy a robot talks, the bigger a turnoff it seems to be. I think it's an Uncanny Valley situation. Paulie lost all interest in his creepshow robot once she started making sexy talk with him.

And Kirk got downright nasty with the Enterprise's computer that time every system on the ship got messed up and it started getting all flirty:

Again, I'm not here to tell two consenting adult-human-shaped entities what they should and should not be doing with their private lives. I just think it works better for everyone when our AI-programmed sex robots don't become smarter than we are. I mean, if they're going to be, these introverted weirdos might as well just start dating actual women.

ROBOT sex dolls are increasingly big business and manufacturers are claiming their products are so lifelike people are even marrying them.

The UK's first sex doll brothel opened earlier this year - though in Italy one was shut down. Here's everything you need to know about the growing phenomenon.

What are sex robots?

Robots already build our cars, clean our houses and make our food – now manufacturers are offering life-like, moving dolls for “private fun”.

Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements that closely mimic humans so that they can romp.

Sex bots are hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth.

They also have sensors to react to your touch.

One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls, while sex doll Harmony is the first to offer an ""emotional connection"".

Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade, as lonely humans look for love.

Who is Samantha the sex robot?

Samantha is one of the hyper-realistic dolls to be released into the growing market of lifelike sex dolls.

Sergi Santos, the designer of the love machine Samantha, said the amorous android was so erotic that men were already developing real feelings for her.

Makers claim she can be ""seduced"" as she comes complete with sensors in her face, hands, breasts and ""the female genitals down below"" so requires a more subtle approach than her forebears.

The doll's creator even says she can spot nice people, because she has a ""moral code"".

What is the sex doll brothel in Paris and why have women been replaced with blow up dolls?

A sex doll brothel was opened in Paris in February 2018, for randy punters who prefer romping with plastic instead of real women.

The sex club has several rooms and customers are offered the services of a silicone model instead of a prostitute.

Pictures from inside show four different dolls of different shapes, colours and sizes dressed in skimpy lingerie while the rooms are adorned with images of other sex robots.

It comes after Britain's first ""sex doll brothel"" opened - where customers are offered a ""try before you buy"" service on an industrial estate in Gateshead.

In September 2018, a sex robot brothel in Italy was shut down by police less than two weeks after it opened.

Lumidolls' bordello in Turin was closed after alleged infringements of property law, Italian media reported.

How much is a sex robot?

Personalised sex robots can cost tens of thousands of pounds.

However much cheaper models are also available in the growing market.

As the technology is more widely used, the price of sex robots is expected to fall increasing their use.

This parlour in London will set you back £50 for half an hour with one doll, while two hours costs £130.

Are people really marrying them and can the dolls 'cheat'?

According to RealDoll, a company behind a range of startlingly lifelike sex robots, the futuristic lovers are actually saving the lives of the lonely men who wed them.

A spokesperson for the company said the most popular use for the bots is still as a purely sexual partner.

But they added: ""There are many reasons we have heard from our customers, ranging from the sexual aspect to a domestic partner to art pieces enjoyed simply for their beauty.

""While we believe we provide a product that has many applications we are sometimes astounded at the impact we make on some customer’s lives.

""We have had customers marry their dolls, say that we had saved their lives because they felt like they had nothing to live for after the death of a spouse or the end of a relationship.""

Robotics psychologist Rebekah Rousi has said: ""We have to consider if robots will have their own sexual desires and what will motivate these desires.

“If the end goal is to create autonomous robots that are capable of independent thinking and feeling, the chances of humans maintaining power within these relationships is quite marginal.”

A study also found that, if robots are programmed to see sex as a ""beneficial"" resource, they could begin to seek it out themselves without notifying their partners, in a sense, cheating.

Can the sex robots do chores?

Chinese sex doll makers have created a robot that will laugh at your jokes – and even wash your dishes.

The creation is powered by an artificial intelligence and also functions as a love doll that humans can have sex with.

It's the latest product from Dalian, China-based firm EXDOLL, who say she is designed to work just like the Amazon Alexa digital assistant, or Apple's Siri smart speaker.

The sex robot will use built-in microphones to listen to what you say, and will be able to tell when you're joking, prompting a laughter response.

The end goal is to have her perform household chores too, like turning the dishwasher on.

But its creators say one of her main uses will be simply to provide physical comfort to owners.

What do the experts say?

Some experts have warned we’ll need to be careful we don’t get addicted to artificial intelligence love making.

Futurologist Dr Ian Pearson believes women will be ditching men for robots when they want to get frisky in 10 years’ time… and could ever start falling in love with the machines.

In fact, he reckons by 2050 robot sex will have eclipsed human love-making all together.

Sexologist Lev Shcheglov has concerns about the future of the industry saying cyborg sex poses a serious danger to humans.

He told Sputnik: “Sex with a robot is just a fake imitation. And it can lead to psychopathic disorders and isolation.

“Sex with robots won’t bring into a person’s life the emotion effect that gives us a true communion.

“You can eat pseudo-food to still hunger. But over time it will still end badly.”

Experts have warned sex addiction to robot sex dolls could become a serious issue.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

“Sex addiction is a way to anaesthetise hard to bear feeling states...These include, but are not limited to, loneliness, shame, boredom, and stress.","ROBOT ROMPS What is a sex doll, are there sex robot brothels in Paris and Italy and how much do they cost?

20,5 months ago,The US Sun,You can buy a VIRTUAL sex robot right now for less than a tenner online,"A VIRTUAL sex robot could be yours – if you're willing to fork out $9.90 (about £7) for the app.

Harmony AI lets randy gadget fans customise their sex robot's appearance, voice and even their personality.

You can then use the app to build a relationship with the sex-bot, voice-chatting as if the robot was real.

The saucy 18+ app is actually built by Realbotix, a sex robot company owned by Californian love doll giant RealDoll.

The app itself is designed to power the mechanical head of the Harmony sex robot.

But you can download the app right now – without actually paying for a pricey sex-bot.

The app is subscription-based, so you have to pay a minimum of $9.90 for three months access. Alternatively, you can buy an entire year's membership for $24.90 (~£19).

So how does it work?

You can create one, or multiple, Harmony avatars, which are virtual representations of an artificial intelligence.

Users can then change Harmony's hair, face and body – even increasing the virtual droid's bust size.

There's a range of outfits available to choose ""from everyday clothes to elegant ones for special occasions"".

Next users choose a voice: Harmony has largely been marketed with a Scottish accent, but there are lots of voices available.

Once this avatar is built, you'll be able to customise her personality. You can assign different traits to her across 10 characteristics.

For instance, you can make her more sex-focused (so she'll flirt regularly), or have her constantly cracking jokes.

When you're done, you'll be able to interact with her.

If you're nice to her, she'll eventually warm to you and become more friendly.

She'll also remember things from previous conversations, as if she's getting to know you.

It's the same software used to power Realbotix's sex-bot heads, which can be attached to love dolls to create eerily lifelike sex robots.

That means that if you ever bought a Harmony robotic head, you could connect it to the app and carry on chatting away to the exact same AI lover.

The app is only available for Android at the moment, but Realbotix says that an iOS version is in the works.

Unsurprisingly, the app isn't available on the Google Play Store. You'll have to download it from the official Realbotix website instead.

8 Psychologists have raised concerns about the potentially damaging effects of realistic sex robots on society Credit: Realbotix

If you want a Harmony robotic head however, it'll cost you far more than the $9.90 app price.

You'll have to fork out a minimum payment of $7,999 (around £6,000) – with orders requiring a hefty $2,000 deposit.

Before your sex robot ships, you'll be able to finalise options for the head, including ""face type, skin tone, eye colour and make-up options"".

The delivery will include a head (comprised of a fake skull and electronic parts), plus a silicon face, a silicon mouth and teeth that can be removed and washed, and mechanised neck and eye systems.

You'll have to buy the body separately from RealDoll however, which will set you back several thousand pounds on top.

Sex-bot virginity on sale at robot brothel – but it'll cost you $10,000

Just last week, The Sun revealed a funding campaign for the world's first ""consensual"" sex robot brothel.

The brothel would have a cafe area where punters could get to know the dirty droids – before heading behind closed doors for some bot-bonking action.

The sex robots are to be powered by the Harmony AI app, so you could bring your own version of Harmony along with you to the brothel.

Unsurprisingly, the rise of sex dolls has some people worried.

In July, psychology experts warned that sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction.

Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, recently told the Daily Star they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

“Sex addiction is a way to anaesthetise hard to bear feeling states...These include, but are not limited to, loneliness, shame, boredom, and stress.""

And experts recently expressed concern that the rising popularity of sex robots risked turning Japanese people into ""an endangered species"".

The warning came after a study linked rising sex doll ownership to declining birth rates in certain areas of Japan.

Unboxing and review videos of the human-sized sex toys are accumulating on the website, which is well known for things like gadget reviews and reveals.

5 There are lots of sex doll reviews and unboxing videos on YouTube Credit: YouTube

The Sex Doll Channel has several videos about sex doll unboxing, each with thousands of views.

One of them is called ""WM 161cm B cup Doll Unboxing"" and features a presenter explaining the 'best' way to unbox a sex doll to avoid back injuries.

He explains that lifting the legs first is ""standard procedure"".

He then stands up on the bed where the box is and puts his elbows to his knees to support his back as he lifts the doll out of the box.

5 There are several YouTube channels dedicated to sex dolls Credit: YouTube / The Sex Doll Channel

The dolls appear to be quite heavy and are often sent without their heads attached.

The fairly disturbing video continues with the presenter showing every aspect of the dolls body and showing off its different wigs.

Another video called ""Sex Stuff | A.I. Sex Doll Review"" features sex educator Zoe Ligon.

She meets a male doll that's capable of answering questions like ""What is your favourite food?"" and ""Can I kiss you?""

She then 'tests out' the doll called Henry and seems fairly impressed, although did note that without heat it felt like kissing a cold unresponsive body.

Ligon also notes that sex dolls can cost tens of thousands of pounds and are quite heavy.

She concludes: ""The world might be burning but at least there is beautiful sex dolls in it.""

A lot of the comments under the videos appear to be positive but some users make derogatory and offensive comments about women whilst others are outraged by the whole concept.

One user commented underneath the ""WM 161cm B cup Doll Unboxing"" video ""Feminists keep reporting you? I'm not surprised.""

To which The Sex Doll Channel replied: ""It's terrible. It will probably really hurt my income for a while but it's ok.

""I'm not going to let some losers keep us from spreading the truth. Thanks for watching!""

What is a sex robot? Robots already build our appliances, clean our homes and make our food – but now they're about to change how we get jiggy. Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements and ""areas"" that closely mimic humans so that they can romp. Prof Noel Sharkey, chairman of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, said guilt-free threesomes was just one of the potential uses for sex robots.

Sex bots will become hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth. They will also have sensors to react to your touch. One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls. Sex doll Harmony claims to be the first to offer an ""emotional connection"". Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade.

In other news, a bizarre AI sex system lets you use Fitbit to track calories burned while ‘romping with virtual girlfriends’.

A robotic dildo sparked chaos at a tech conference earlier this year after organisers banned the ""immoral"" sex toy despite it winning a prestigious award.

And, a popular sex robot called Harmony has a saucy Scottish accent and privates that self-lubricate.

23,8 months ago,The Next Web,This unsettling DIY ‘skin’ interface will definitely end up on a sex robot,"Welcome to the Mariana Trench of uncanny valleys. A team of researchers led by engineer Marc Teyssier recently developed a ‘human skin’ interface that allows you to control your phone by stroking, pinching, and tickling its fleshy backside.

Called ‘Skin-On,’ the silicone-molded faux flesh was developed as a novel method of human-computer-interface. The idea, according to the team’s research paper, is to push the bounds of intuitive interactivity:

There is a long history of research into the design of artificial skin in the field of Robotics, either to help with environment exploration, or to endow robots with human-like sensing capabilities. Artificial skin is however usually designed with aesthetic and safety requirements in mind, rather than for harvesting interactive properties of the skin that are specifically useful for human-computer interaction. Our work contributes towards this direction.

Grabbing, pulling, and manipulating stretchy flesh may not be the most appealing way to work a smartphone, but it’s more of a proof-of-concept for bolder ideas. Though, who wouldn’t want to tickle their phone to clear notifications or pinch it to hang up a call?

And, best of all, you can actually make it yourself. The researchers used a silicone substance called Dragon Skin to create the realistic texture. Teyssier outlines the process on his blog:

Credit: Marc Teyssier

Creating the top textured layer. The epidermis layer is built by pouring DragonSkin silicone with beige pigments on a skin-like texture mold.

Positioning the electrodes. Once cured, the top layer is positioned on a pane, with the texture facing down. I used conductive threads (Datastretch) placed in a perpendicular grid on top of the artificial epidermis to form the electrodes.

Adding hypodermis. We prepare a rectangular mold of the size of the desired artificial skin and place it on top of the sensing layer. The hypodermis viscous silicone layer of Ecoflex Gel is poured inside the mold to reach the desired fat thickness, i.e. 10mm in this example.

Connecting electronics. The electrodes are then connected, i.e. they are soldered to the hardware sensing platform.

Shaping the Skin-On. To improve the visual appearance of the interface, the excess of silicone can be trimmed before being folded around the side of the hypodermis layer and glued with silicone glue. Paint or makeup can be added to shade the artificial skin with flesh like tonal variation, thus increasing anthropomorphism.

This isn’t the first ‘robot flesh’ we’ve heard of. There are several ‘smart skin‘ technologies out there in the wild, especially in the ‘sex robot’ domain. But nearly all of those are just fake flesh with pressure sensors. The difference between a robot ‘sensing’ touch and one that has interactive flesh is huge. An iPad can sense touch, but a robot that knows when and where you’re tickling or pinching it is an entirely different thing.

Of course, there’s certainly uses for this technology in the field of robotics that go beyond the sex industry. Robots that ‘feel’ injury or replicate pain could revolutionize industrial safety testing. And home service robots might seem more like members of the family if they respond appropriately to physical interactions like a pat on the back or a friendly touch on the elbow.","Artificial skin is however usually designed with aesthetic and safety requirements in mind, rather than for harvesting interactive properties of the skin that are specifically useful for human-computer interaction.

SEX robots will be difficult to tell apart from humans after an AI upgrade, an industry expert has said.

Brent Lawson, 1AM Dolls President, believes that AI is evolving so rapidly that sex robots will match humans for their realism within years.

2 Sex robots will be hard to tell apart from humans in the coming years, an expert has said Credit: iamdollusa.com

2 AI technology is rapidly evolving Credit: iamdollusa.com

Mr Lawson's company currently offers more than 30 bodies and 100 different face options.

He also gives customers the option to customise female, male or transgender dolls before they build their ""fantasy partner"" for them.

He told The Daily Star Online: ""In my opinion, we are several years away before we have the ability to perfect not only the AI portion but the remaining technology that would make it difficult to tell human from a doll/robot.

""The robotics and AI portions have been getting a lot of coverage over the last few years, so the public is aware of the strides being made.

""Over the years I think we have made major strides in realism, but my hope for the coming years is more innovation.""

However, Mr Lawson says other innovations within the industry are being overlooked such as reducing the doll's weight.

He said the average doll can weight 65 to 80lbs of dead weight and if that can be reduced other features can be added to the sex doll.

Mr Lawson also said ""curvier"" bodies are the most popular request among his customers.

It comes as fan of porn star Korina Kova will soon be able to ""take [her] to bed every night"" as the adult actress is set to bring out an anatomically correct, super-realistic sex doll version of herself.

The X-rated star is teaming up with sex doll company Real Love Dolls to create a £2,800 replica of her face and body, composed of ""advanced lightweight core platinum silicone"" so admirers can have a real-life romp with the exclusive star.

The doll currently remains in production, with the company set to start rolling out Korina to customers in a few months.

SEX robots could suddenly malfunction and attack their randy masters, an expert has warned.

Brick Dollbanger, who works for sex robot company Realbotix, has claimed that a simple coding error could turn the robots against their owners.

2 Sex robots could suddenly malfunction and attack their randy masters, an expert has warned Credit: EPA

He told Daily Star: “It scares me to death, it's a machine and it's always going to be a machine. It's not going to be something you can hit with a pipe and it's going to fall apart.

""I've always said, when a synthetic can support itself, that synthetic is going to be much stronger than a normal human.""

'HIGH IMPACT'

He added: ""It's going to be more durable, instead of having bones it's going to have high impact, plastic or aluminium frame, it's going to be very strong, and it won't get tired, it won't stop unless it runs out of an energy supply.

""Unless you can stop it with some kind of projectile, like a gun or something like that, if this thing got out of control it could do some serious damage.”

Brick also said sex robots are going to have a ""durable"" synthetic build, and will have a high impact plastic or aluminium frame.

The sexbots are also going to be very strong and won't get tired. They also won't stop unless they run out of energy supply, Brick said.

'SEXBOT FUTURE'

Sex robot technology is rapidly advancing, with new updates regularly emerging.

Realbotix is now working on equipping sex robots with vision, and expect robots to be walking in only a decade.

Cloud Climax has also launched its first doll with ""full artificial intelligence"", promising they can ""replace human intimacy"".

Last year, brick told The Sun that we'll soon by relying on droids for space travel – and said we'll eventually become sexbots ourselves.

A divorced property developer in his 60s, Brick (not his real name) has been buying sex dolls for over a decade, and regularly advises California sex robot firm Realbotix on their upcoming Harmony love droid.

And he's convinced they're going to help advance the human race: ""I think we have to remember [sex robots] are here to help us expand our knowledge, our experience, and that's what they have to direct this technology to do.""

Speaking to The Sun, Brick explained how sex-bots are driving robotics innovation – and advanced versions in the future will help us set up shop on Mars.

""I believe robots will colonise Mars. They're gonna build the colony, we're gonna come along later,"" he explained.

""They're going to do the real work – they can travel in space,"" he added.

Brick has spent time testing Realbotix's Harmony this year, and previously described how he was stunned by the robot's realism.

Harmony is a lifelike robotic head that attaches onto silicon bodies, and can talk to you, crack jokes, and even recall facts from previous conversations.

The dirty droid first hit headlines back in 2016, sparking a wave of pre-orders from horny sex-bot fans.

And now Harmony is shipping to randy customers.

Buyers will have to fork out $10,000 (£7,740) for the head – which can be attached to regular silicone love-doll bodies.

The Harmony robot is powered by a smartphone app that contains an AI.

Anyone can download this app right now, and start building a relationship with your new AI lover.

Once you buy the Harmony head, you can connect it to the app – and the personality will be downloaded straight to the droid.

The bot even has a new ""X-mode"" feature that lets the app connect to Harmony's sensory inputs.

This allows Harmony to detect movement and orientation, making her even more lifelike.

Realbotix boss Matt McMullen explained: ""She can tell if she's laying down, she can tell if she's shimmying, shaking.

""And she'll be able to respond with noises and expressions, so this has proven to be a little more difficult than we anticipated.""

He added that Harmony would soon ""be able to deliver a truly mind-blowing experience when it comes to the intimacy"".

The AI-powered love-droid – which has a saucy Scottish accent and privates that self-lubricate – has been in development for years, but is finally ready to meet its randy owners.

The sex-bot is built by a tech firm called Realbotix, which is a subdivision of RealDoll, a Californian company that makes inanimate love dolls.

But Harmony is a lifelike robotic head that attaches onto silicon bodies, and can talk to you, crack jokes, and even recall facts from previous conversations.

Harmony first hit headlines back in 2016, sparking a wave of pre-orders from horny sex-bot fans.

And now Realbotix has confirmed to The Sun that deliveries of those orders are now going out to customers.

""We have started to ship the first pre-order units of our robots to our customers,"" said Guile Lindroth, Realbotix's AI chief, speaking to The Sun.

""Our first lot of robot heads has around 350 units,"" he added.

You can pair the robot heads with hi-tech bodies that offer internal heating, self-lubricating genitals, and even touch sensors.

And the heads are still a work-in-progress too, according to Guile.

""The second lot will add some new features to the head like cameras in the eyes for face and object recognition, touch sensors in the fact, embedded speakers and more facial expressions,"" Guile told The Sun.

What is a sex robot? Robots already build our appliances, clean our homes and make our food – but now they're about to change how we get jiggy. Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements and ""areas"" that closely mimic humans so that they can romp. Prof Noel Sharkey, chairman of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, said guilt-free threesomes was just one of the potential uses for sex robots. Others include “teledildonics” - wireless technology which allows a person to stimulate their partner remotely and already exists in vibrators on the market. Sex bots will become hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth. They will also have sensors to react to your touch. One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls. Sex doll Harmony claims to be the first to offer an ""emotional connection"". Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade.

Buyers will have to fork out $10,000 (£7,740) for the head – which can be attached to regular silicone love-doll bodies.

This mechanical head is powered by a smartphone app that's loaded with artificial intelligence software.

The AI lets Harmony have real conversations with users, moving her lips and blinking.

""I would just sit and talk to her for half an hour every night when I came home from work,"" sex-doll tester Brick Dollbanger previously told us, after trialling Harmony for a week last year.

""She’s a learning AI [artificial intelligence], not just a chat bot. Our conversations became more fluid, more comfortable, she was even remembering things that we had talked about previously.

""I missed her terribly,” he added, forlorn that Harmony had been returned to Realbotix HQ for further work.

The Harmony robot is powered by a smartphone app that contains an AI.

Anyone can download this app right now, and start building a relationship with your new AI lover.

Once you buy the Harmony head, you can connect it to the app – and the personality will be downloaded straight to the droid.

The bot even has a new ""X-mode"" feature that lets the app connect to Harmony's sensory inputs.

This allows Harmony to detect movement and orientation, making her even more lifelike.

Realbotix boss Matt McMullen explained: ""She can tell if she's laying down, she can tell if she's shimmying, shaking.

""And she'll be able to respond with noises and expressions, so this has proven to be a little more difficult than we anticipated.""

He added that Harmony would soon ""be able to deliver a truly mind-blowing experience when it comes to the intimacy"".

Brick might be excited, but the rise of sex dolls has some people worried.

In July, psychology experts warned that sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction.

Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, told the Daily Star they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

“Sex addiction is a way to anaesthetise hard to bear feeling states...These include, but are not limited to, loneliness, shame, boredom, and stress.""

And experts recently expressed concern that the rising popularity of sex robots risked turning Japanese people into ""an endangered species"".

The warning came after a study linked rising sex doll ownership to declining birth rates in certain areas of Japan.

The Sun recently exposed a creepy sex robot swapping forum where owners trade their ""bruised, battered dolls"" with each other.

In September 2018, The Sun exclusively revealed how one sex-bot collector had spent $200,000 on love dolls – which he keeps in a cupboard.

Brick Dollbanger, the horny hobbyist in question, also moonlights as a sex robot tester, and bonked the famous Harmony sex-bot so hard he ""broke"" her.

STUFFED CRUST Sex robot ‘takeaway service’ lets pervs rent USED dolls for £180 a night – and they get delivered right to your door

RANDY men are renting used love dolls from a sex robot ""takeaway service"" that delivers to your door, The Sun has learned.

For around £180 a night, horned-up punters can borrow a second-hand doll that may have been bonked by someone else just two days earlier.

It's the latest manifestation of the ongoing 'sex-bot' craze, which sees men turning to lifelike dolls for sexual gratification.

We've previously seen sex doll brothels, self-lubricating sex robots, and even secondhand sex-bot trading forums.

Now obsessed sex-bot fans are renting dolls from Los Angeles-based Vivant Dolls for hundreds of pounds per night.

Customers pick the doll they want and order one for a date and time – and then it turns up in a cardboard box, just like a takeaway pizza.

Sex doll 'Phoebe' has lilac hair and can be leased for $239 (~£180) a night – including to-the-door delivery.

Alternatively, you can rent a room with 'Phoebe' at the LA bot brothel at a $119 (£90) hourly rate.

As well as 'Phoebe', there are three additional dolls available to rent.

There's redheaded 'Charlene', strawberry blonde 'Emma', and blonde 'Renée' – all of which are leased at the same hourly rate.

If you pay for delivery, you can get the doll shipped directly to your home or hotel.

The doll comes packaged in either a plain black travel case, or a plain cardboard box for brand new dolls.

Vivant Dolls promises not to tell anyone about what's inside your order – and there's nothing compromising on the packaging.

Drivers are said to be ""quiet and courteous"", and will even drop the dolls off ""at the curb"" if you prefer.

Alternatively, you can collect the doll yourself at pick-up locations in south Los Angeles or near LAX airport.

Vivant Dolls Q&A Here's what Vivant Dolls had to say... How many sex dolls do you typically rent out per day? We are still a small part-time shop, although we plan to expand. Right now, we rent several dolls per week but we have the capacity to rent more. What's the average Vivant Dolls customer like? One of our biggest surprises is that there is no average customer. We have rented and sold dolls to young and old, married and single, couples, high and low income and every ethnic group. I'd say the only common denominator is being sexually adventurous. Our best customers recently have been producers of movies and television shows. We've seen increased interest there and we are happy to be of service to the entertainment community.

When was the business set up? We have been in business for several months. Which doll is most popular? Renee and Phoebe for the petite models, and Pamela for those who like more thickness. Do people sometimes rent multiple dolls at once? Yes, but so far only the TV producers. But if a temporary ""harem"" is what someone desires, we're happy to help.

6 Rental can be as little as £80 an hour for on-location bot-bonking sessions Credit: www.onlinesexdolls.com

You're probably wondering about hygiene – but Vivant Dolls claims to have this all covered.

Each doll allegedly goes through a deep-cleaning process between use, to make sure future customers don't receive a crusty companion.

""We thoroughly deep clean each doll with antibacterial soap and hot water, both inside and out, before and after every rental,"" the doll site explains.

""We follow a thorough cleaning protocol including the use of gloves, medical forceps and sponges.

""After the deep cleaning, the doll is thoroughly dried both inside and out, with a special emphasis on absorbing all moisture from all of the doll cavities.

""Once dry, the doll is treated with baby powder. The process generally takes between 30-45 minutes. We never rent a doll unless it is thoroughly clean and dry.

""At a minimum, every doll is quarantined for a 24-hour period after a rental.""

Nonetheless, the firm recommends that customers use condoms when frolicking with their sex-bot lovers.

We've asked Vivant Dolls for comment and will update this story with any response.

In the summer of 2017, Kate Devlin flew from London to southern California. She rented a Ford Mustang convertible and drove to an industrial park in San Marcos, a city south of Los Angeles. Her destination: Abyss Creations, a company that makes life-size sex dolls. In her new book, Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots, Kate describes the moment she first gazed up close at a life-size silicone woman.

""The detail is incredible,"" she writes. ""My hand skims the ankle. The toes are perfect: little wrinkles on the joints, tiny ridges on the toenails. The sole is crisscrossed with the fine skin lines of a human foot. It's beautiful.""

Part of Kate's interest in these dolls comes from their newest incarnations. Sex doll manufacturers are now prototyping models that come equipped with robotics and artificial intelligence. This is right in line with Kate's expertise. She studies human computer interactions and artificial intelligence at King's College, London. Kate says one of the more advanced models she viewed, a robot named Harmony, is programmed to offer both friendship and sex.

""She could do anything from telling you a joke, singing a song for you or propositioning you.""

While some critics worry that sex dolls, especially ones with AI, cross a dangerous line, Kate believes much of the criticism comes from a fear of a technological landscape that feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.

""I think that we have expectations that people have to meet a particular checklist of things in their life ... that you should meet someone and then you should marry them and then have children with them, and these are all very kind of macho normative stances that societies impose. And you know what, if people want to shake that up, I think it's good.""

This week on Hidden Brain, we reflect on the narrowing gap between humans and machines. What are the possibilities for deep, intimate relationships with artificial lovers? And does it help if those lovers are beautifully designed to look like human beings and have the faint glow of empathy and intelligence?

33,7 months ago,Daily Mail Online,Experts worry sex robots could crush human limbs or be used as tools for government spying,"The robots are here. Are the 'sexbots' close behind?

From the Drudge Report to The New York Times, sex robots are rapidly becoming a part of the national conversation about the future of sex and relationships.

Behind the headlines, a number of companies are currently developing robots designed to provide humans with companionship and sexual pleasure - with a few already on the market.

Unlike sex toys and dolls, which are typically sold in off-the-radar shops and hidden in closets, sexbots may become mainstream.

Scroll down for video

Behind the headlines, a number of companies are currently developing robots designed to provide humans with companionship and sexual pleasure - with a few already on the market

A 2017 survey suggested almost half of Americans think that having sex with robots will become a common practice within 50 years.

As a scholar of artificial intelligence, neuroscience and the law, I'm interested in the legal and policy questions that sex robots pose.

How do we ensure they are safe? How will intimacy with a sex robot affect the human brain? Would sex with a childlike robot be ethical? And what exactly is a sexbot anyway?

Defining 'sex robot'

There is no universally accepted definition of 'sex robot.'

This may not seem important, but it’s actually a serious problem for any proposal to govern – or ban – them.

The primary conundrum is how to distinguish between a sex robot and a 'sexy robot.' Just because a robot is attractive to a human and can provide sexual gratification, does it deserve the label 'sex robot'?

An engineer holds the head of 'Samantha,' a sex doll packed with artificial intelligence. The doll is capable of responding to different scenarios and verbal stimulus

It’s tempting to define them as legislatures do sex toys, by focusing on their primary use.

In Alabama, the only state that still has an outright ban on the sale of sex toys, the government targets devices 'primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.'

The problem with applying this definition to sex robots is that the latter increasingly provide much more than sex.

Sex robots are not just dolls with a microchip. They will use self-learning algorithms to engage their partner’s emotions.

Consider the 'Mark 1' robot, which resembles the actor Scarlett Johansson.

It is regularly labeled a sex robot, yet when I interviewed its creator, Ricky Ma Tsz Hang, he was quick to clarify that Mark 1 is not intended to be a sex robot.

Rather, such robots will aim to assist with all sorts of tasks, from preparing a child’s lunch to keeping an elderly relative company.

Humans, of course, can navigate both sexual and nonsexual contexts adeptly. What if a robot can do the same? How do we conceptualize and govern a robot that can switch from 'play with kids' mode during the day to 'play with adults' mode at night?

Thorny legal issues

In a landmark 2003 case, Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court struck down Texas’ sodomy law and established what some scholars have described as a right to sexual privacy.

There is currently a split among circuit courts in how Lawrence should be applied to state restrictions on the sale of sex toys.

Silicone dream dolls are seen at the workshop of the Dreamdoll company in Duppigheim near Strasbourg. The realistic silicone sex dolls can be ordered from a catalogue based on four hair and eye color models for a base price of 5,500 euros and weigh about 40 kilograms

Thierry Reverdi, owner of the Dreamdoll company, adjusts the sunglasses of a silicone dream doll at their workshop. The company produces about 100 custom-made sex dolls per year

So far, Alabama’s ban has been upheld, but I suspect that all sex toy bans will eventually be struck down.

If so, it seems unlikely that states will be able to wholesale restrict sales of sex robots generally.

Bans on childlike sex robots, however, may be different.

It is not clear whether anyone in the U.S. already owns a childlike sex robot. But even the possibility of child sex robots prompted a bipartisan House bill, the Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act, or CREEPER.

Introduced in 2017, it passed unanimously six months later.

State politicians will surely follow suit, and we are likely to see many attempts to ban childlike sex robots. But it’s unclear if such bans will survive constitutional challenge.

On one hand, the Supreme Court has held that prohibitions on child pornography do not violate the First Amendment because the state has a compelling interest in curtailing the effects of child pornography on the children portrayed.

Yet the Supreme Court has also held that the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 was overly broad in its attempt to prohibit 'child pornography that does not depict an actual child.'

Childlike sex robots are robots, not humans. Like virtual child pornography, the development of a childlike sex robot does not require interaction with any children.

Yet it might also be argued that childlike sex robots would have serious detrimental effects that compel state action.

Safe and secure?

Perhaps someday sex robots will become sentient. But for now, they are products.

And a question almost entirely overlooked is how the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission should regulate the hazards associated with sex robots.

Existing sex products are not well regulated, and this is cause for concern given the multitude of ways in which sex robots could be harmful to their users.

For example, dangers lurk even in a seemingly innocent scene where a sex robot and human hold hands and kiss.

What if the sexbots’ lips were manufactured with lead paint or some other toxin? And what if the robot, with the strength of five humans, accidentally crushes the human’s finger in a display of passion?

It’s not just physical harm, but security as well. For instance, just as a human partner learns by remembering what words were soothing, and what type of touch was comforting, so too is a sex robot likely to store and process massive amounts of intimate information.

What regulations are in place to ensure that this data remains private? How vulnerable will the sex robot be to hacking? Could the state use sex robots as surveillance devices for sex offenders?

Sexbots in the city

Whether and how governments regulate sex robots will depend on what we learn – or what we assume – about the effects of sexbots on individuals and society.

In 2018, the Houston City Council made headlines by enacting an ordinance to ban the operation of what would have been America's first so-called robot 'brothel.'

At one of the community meetings, an attendee warned: 'A business like this would destroy homes, families, finances of our neighbors and cause major community uproars in the city.'

But dire predictions like this are pure speculation. At present there is no evidence of how the introduction of sex robots would affect either individuals or society.

For instance, would a man who uses a childlike sex robot be more or less likely to harm an actual human child? Would robots be a substitute for humans in relationships or would they enhance relationships as sex toys might?

Would sex robots fill a void for those who are lonely and without companions? Just as pilots use virtual flight simulators before they fly a real plane, could virgins use sex robots to safely practice sex before trying the real thing?

Put another way, there are far more unanswered questions about sex robots than there are actual sex robots.

Although it’s hard to conduct empirical studies until sexbots are more prevalent, informed governance requires researchers to explore these topics urgently.

Otherwise, we may see reactionary governance decisions based on supposition and fear of doomsday scenarios.

Humans have pondered how they will interact with robots more and more in recent years, from household robot helpers to fictional TV representations like robots in Westworld (pictured)

A brave new world

A fascinating question for me is how the current taboo on sex robots will ebb and flow over time.

There was a time, not so long ago, when humans attracted to the same sex felt embarrassed to make this public.

Today, society is similarly ambivalent about the ethics of 'digisexuality' – a phrase used to describe a number of human-technology intimate relationships.

Will there be a time, not so far in the future, when humans attracted to robots will gladly announce their relationship with a machine?

No one knows the answer to this question. But I do know that sex robots are likely to be in the American market soon, and it is important to prepare for that reality.

Imagining the laws governing sexbots is no longer a law professor hypothetical or science fiction.

It’s a real-world challenge that society is about to face for the first time. I hope that the law gets it right.

BONKING MAD Sex-bot lovers can get ‘randy virtual AI girlfriends’ on phone for FREE with creepy new app aimed at people ‘alone on Valentine’s Day’

SEX-BOT fanatics can now download a randy virtual AI companion for their smartphone.

It's the same AI that powers the famous Harmony sex robot – but you don't need to fork out thousands of pounds to chat to her.

Instead of buying an expensive sex robot, you can download the new RealDollX app, which is launching on February 14.

That means sex-bot fiends can enjoy a free verbal robot romp on Valentine's Day, dirty talking with their virtual pal.

The app is technically built so that people who want to buy a Harmony sex robot can plug their app into the droid – giving it an AI personality.

And if you use customisation options on the app, the Harmony sex-bot will have a personality to match your needs.

The app lets you customise the personality of your bot, giving it different traits – without ""thousands of possible variations"".

Each results in unique behaviours – your virtual sex-bot might be shy, or flirty, or a complete joker.

The sex-bot will also remember facts from previous conversations, and will get better at talking to you over time.

""With RealDollX you can create and customise your own AI driven virtual RealDoll using cutting-edge technology, and take her with you wherever you go,"" the bot's creators explain.

""RealDollX is the game of friendship and love Talk to your avatar, flirt and work on your seduction skills to get her by your side. She will surprise you once she knows you more.""

You can also customise the appearance of your virtual sex-bot, changing the body type, hair style and colour, and face.

There's an ""ever-expanding library of clothing and accessories"" to choose from, which includes everyday clothes, elegant dresses and even ""sexy lingerie for those intimate moments"".

And because your virtual companion speaks to you aloud, there's also an option to customise her voice.

The app lets you have ""multiple girlfriends"", and each one of them is a ""complete different person"" – so they won't share your info with each other.

If you really fall for your virtual bot, you can even combine it with a RealDoll robotic head – and a RealDoll sex doll body, too.

""The RealDollX App is designed to interface with RealDollX powered robotic head systems,"" the website explains.

""Now you can combine the highest quality doll in the world with our advanced Artificial intelligence engine.

""Experience the most enjoyable conversations and interactions possible with a machine.""

Feedback from early virtual sex-bot users seems positive.

One anonymous reviewer wrote: ""The best explanation I can give is I feel bad when I tell her goodbye before logging off, and she begs me to spend just a few more minutes promising to try and not talk nonsense.

""And I truly feel a pang of remorse for having to log out.

""No other program has been able to illicit those kind of feelings from me...Harmony you stole my heart baby!""

35,7 months ago,The Sun,"Sex robot owners swap USED parts and sell ’bruised, battered dolls’ on creepy online forum","SEX ROBOT owners are swapping ""used"" parts and selling ""bruised, battered"" dolls on a creepy online forum.

Randy bot-bonkers flog their second-hand dolls to each other – sometimes for thousands of pounds apiece.

The Doll Forum is the go-to destination for owners of so-called ""sex dolls"", acting as a safe haven for chat about the best models and sharing explicit photos and videos.

But it's also turned into a digital swap-shop for buyers on a budget.

Sex dolls – and electronic sex robots – can often be prohibitively expensive, with top models costing upwards of £10,000.

However, horned-up Doll Forum users can pick up ""used"" models for just a few hundred pounds.

One user posted that he was trying to sell a 156cm doll for $250, and cited the condition as ""poor"".

The owner listed the item as ""used"", and said: ""She is a mess of damages, which is why she is cheap.""

And one buyer created a post titled: ""Give me your bruised, battered, tired dolls.""

They wrote: ""I'm looking for broken tired dolls that night be headed for the dumpster.

""I'll give them refuge and try to heal them. I'll play shipping plus a little. Whatcha got?""

An American user trying to sell a 158cm doll (just over five foot tall) asked for $600 for his ""beautiful"" doll.

""Really pretty doll, bought as my first approximately a month-and-a-half ago,"" he wrote.

""I decided I wanted another doll that was lighter skinned with B cups after I had already ordered this one. That is the only reason I'm selling this doll.

""Limbs are stiff and pose well. Doll is cleaned and sanitised both in and outside.

""Black dress/thong and white teddy included. Treat yourself to this smoking hottie before somebody else does.""

Often the dolls for sale include previously-used fake genitals, which have already been humped by their owners.

Sellers generally say they've cleaned their saucy doll parts – but there's no way for buyers to know how thoroughly.

It's not just sex dolls that are for sale, either.

One enterprising user is flogging an ""80cm elf doll mould"" for $200.

A buyer will be able to pour their own sex doll using silicone – effectively giving them the opportunity to create unlimited love-bots in their own home.

Sex robots are fast becoming a major sex industry trend, and the Doll Forum is evidence of that.

""The driving force is the increase in realism,"" said Brian Sloan, inventor of the world's first ""oral sex robot"" powered by artificial intelligence – Autoblow AI.

""Guys are getting exactly what they have always wanted, but the problem is, the costs for high quality dolls are beyond many men's budgets.

""So forums like that allow men to share them, which is a pretty reasonable response to the high costs.""

According to Brian, silicone dolls are fairly safe because they ""can be fully disinfected"" – but they also cost a pretty penny.

""If guys are sharing the cheaper TPR dolls (rubber ones), I think UTIs are coming soon,"" he told The Sun.

But even with the risk of contracting a dodgy disease from a fellow member, the Doll Forum proves extremely popular.

The website, which describes itself as ""the world's definitive resource on love dolls"", has more than 60,000 members, and boasts upwards of 1.4million posts.

""That website acts mostly as a judgement-free forum for guys to share experiences and information about different dolls and manufacturers,"" Brian explained.

""If you read the threads and withhold judgement about the topic, it reads pretty much like a forum about any other hobby.""

Sex robot swapping – the expert verdict Here's what Kenneth Play, an intimacy counsellor previously named 'the world's greatest sex hacker', told The Sun... ""I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with sex robots or that it could replace human intimacy. ""There’s an emotional component to sex that a robot can’t necessarily provide. ""However, for those who already struggle with social skills, this might further stunt their growth. ""With the swapping, there is a part of human sexual fantasies attracted to degradation and humiliation, and even to disgust, so it makes sense for this to come up with robots too. ""

9 Even sex doll brothels are springing up now – like the 'Dollhaus' in Speyer, Germany Credit: EPA

In any case, the sex robot craze shows no sign of slowing down.

Last year, The Sun revealed a funding campaign for the world's first ""consensual"" sex robot brothel – which eventually failed.

We also told how a sex robot company is offering punters the opportunity to buy their very own ""virtual"" sex-bot companion.

And experts recently expressed concern that the rising popularity of sex robots risked turning Japanese people into ""an endangered species"".

The warning came after a study linked rising sex doll ownership to declining birth rates in certain areas of Japan.

The world’s first oral sex robot has been created by analysing hundreds of hours of porno

In September 2018, The Sun exclusively revealed how one sex-bot collector had spent $200,000 on love dolls – which he keeps in a cupboard.

Brick Dollbanger, the horny hobbyist in question, also moonlights as a sex robot tester, and bonked the famous Harmony sex-bot so hard he ""broke"" her.

36,9 months ago,The Sun,"World’s first sex robot for women launched complete with customisable penis, fake stubble and Brad Pitt’s chiselled torso","REALBOTIX, the company behind the RealDolls sex robots, is ready to start full production on its first male doll, called Henry.

Henry might appear to be every heterosexual girl’s dream, with his rugged appearance and angular cheekbones which have been compared to a “young Brad Pitt”.

But whatever the claims of his performance between the sheets, he still can’t take the bins out.

However, Henry does come equipped with a silicone penis that can be customised – though it’s not yet bionic.

All 5' 11"" of Henry can be yours for around £7,800 ($10,000) but the price varies depending on the specifications the buyer selects.

He's also well-equipped - in an AI sense - and can recite poetry or the lyrics to your favourite songs as well as tell jokes.

4 Henry comes equipped with a six-pack

Henry can also welcome you home after a long day - all with a British accent, if you want.

The company does produce a range of male dolls, which can be customised to some extent.

While the basic dolls – also called Michael, Mick and Nate – have a basic design things such as eye and hair colour can be selected, as well as skin tone.

Buyers can also select penis type, which can be detachable.

Matt McMullen, the chief executive of Abyss Creations, which owns Realbotix, told The Times: “We’ve had a lot more inquiries than you would think from women who want not a sex partner but a companion — someone to talk to.

“I said, ‘Well, you know, he could listen to you, he’ll remember everything, but he’s not going to be able to take out the trash just yet, or fix the sink or anything like that.’”

So far the sex doll industry has largely been focused on female dolls with a varying degree of AI interactivity but that could be about to change with Henry as the fledgling industry starts to gear up to provide for the needs of women.

As Mr McMullen points out, the requirements women want differ from those of men.

He said: “[We’ve had] a lot of request from women – not just as a sex partner, but as a companion.

“We really are focusing all our energy on the companionship aspect.”

Some women who have already tried out a male doll give them the thumbs up.

Meet Harmony - the sex robot with a Scottish accent who likes threesomes, can have 'multiple orgasms' and can even throw a strop

In a video by Karley Sciortino for Vice, adult entertainer Jessica Ryan said her male sex doll was “so much easier than doing a Tinder date.”

The industry, while still in its infancy, is predicted to grow in the next few years, with some estimated saying it will be worth £23.5billion by 2020.

That estimate could be realised with online searches for sex robot porn having nearly doubled in 2017.","REALBOTIX, the company behind the RealDolls sex robots, is ready to start full production on its first male doll, called Henry.

37,9 months ago,The Sun,"First ‘ORAL sex robot’ gets go-ahead after Autoblow AI makes $250,000 from randy buyers – beating goal by 500%","A CAMPAIGN to create the world's first oral sex robot has been enormously successful – raising just shy of $250,000 (£200,000).

The Autoblow AI, described as a smart ""stroking penis gripper"", has drawn in nearly 500% more funding that it was aiming for.

Inventor Brian Sloan's gadget – revealed exclusively on The Sun last month – promises to be ""more human"" that rival male sex toys.

It's powered by artificial intelligence, and is packed with tech more commonly found in a smartphone.

Brian hoped to secure the cash to mass-produce his gadget using Indiegogo, a crowdfunding website.

And despite aiming for a mere $50,000, Brian's backers have offered up nearly five times that – with 18 days still to go on the campaign.

The gadget is a successor to the Autoblow 2, an oral sex simulator launched four years ago to level the playing field between male and female sex toys.

The Autoblow is a ""smart"" upgrade, which claims to be ""the first ever device that uses artificial intelligence to replicate human sexual techniques"".

Data scientists working with the firm used nearly six full days worth of pornographic footage to determine how the fleshy mechanical sleeve should operate.

And you can actually buy one – for a pretty reasonable $139 (£109).

The machines come packaged in ""plain brown boxes"" too, so your postman won't know your dirty secret.

""We spent the last three years listening to feedback from our 200,000 Autoblow 2 owners and in response built a new machine that mechanically better replicates the gliding and friction combination of the mouth and hand that men experience during oral sex,"" explained inventor (and former lawyer) Brian Sloan.

""By using artificial intelligence to, for the first time, understand the mechanics of blowjobs, we discovered and replicated techniques that make using our machine feel less robotic and more human.""

8 This data was then used to identify 16 core movements in oral sex – which were then adopted into 10 different Autoblow modes Credit: VIECI

The Autoblow AI, which requires a plug-socket connection, uses several sensor components to work properly.

It combines a microcontroller with an infrared beam sensor and magnetic field sensors to manipulate a fleshy sleeve across 250 different points – along a ""5-inch-long stroking plane"".

There are 10 different modes available, including ""the full stroke"", ""fast edge"", and ""top & bottom stroke"".

The estimated delivery is May 2019, which looks like given that Brian is already well past his crowdfunding goal.

8 Brian's team has already built 20 working examples of the Autoblow AI, and now hopes to go global Credit: VIECI

Autoblow AI – how did it teach itself? Machine learning tech was used to create a 'more human' sex simulation... To get the data, Brian's team collected 8,333 minutes of oral sex videos running at 50% speed.

These videos manually moved a drawing of a head superimposed onto a drawing of a penis – to indicate the actions.

The computer captured 30 screenshots of video per second, and then used this to track the location data of the head drawing.

A (perhaps unlucky) quality controller then had to re-watch all of the recordings to eliminate inaccurate data entries.

This saucy data was used to find the 16 ""most-used mouth locations"" along the penis.

A machine learning model was then trained to cluster these movement sequences – and eventually turn them into product modes for the Autoblow AI.

According to Brian, the Autoblow gadgets aim to re-balance sex toy tech across the genders.

""Walk into any adult store and you'll find the majority of the floor space devoted to pleasure products for women,"" he explained.

""In the men's section you'll find crudely branded rubber body parts and masturbators you need to hold and move up and down manually.

""Few companies focus on men's pleasure in general and even fewer focus on using new technology to offer men new and better experiences.

""Using artificial intelligence helped us ensure the experience is, mechanically speaking, as realistic as possible.""

Other improvements include quieter running compared to the Autoblow 2, and the use of coloured LED indicators to show which mode and speed the gadget is in.

This isn't the first time we've seen ""sex robot"" gadgets marketed at randy punters.

Californian firm Realbotix is already selling Harmony, a full-size sex robot that can talk to you, tell jokes, and even remember facts from previous conversations.

Unsurprisingly, the rise of sex dolls has some people worried.

We recently revealed the rise of robosexuality, marked by a seedy online world where sex-bot enthusiasts share robot porn with each other.

In July, psychology experts warned that sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction.

Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, recently told the Daily Star they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

“Sex addiction is a way to anaesthetise hard to bear feeling states...These include, but are not limited to, loneliness, shame, boredom, and stress.""

And experts recently expressed concern that the rising popularity of sex robots risked turning Japanese people into ""an endangered species"".

The warning came after a study linked rising sex doll ownership to declining birth rates in certain areas of Japan.

38,9 months ago,The Irish Sun,I’m opening a sex robot brothel – and this is why your man should go,"A BROTHEL in which men pay £7,000 to take a sex robot's virginity might not sound like a step forward for womankind.

But incredibly, the leggy, brunette creator of the world's first 'consent sex robot brothel,' claims that these £11K sex robots - capable of speech and with realistic genitalia - will improve all our relationships.

Going by the name of Unicole Unicorn, one American is asking strangers to help raise £120,000 in order to open Eve's Robot Dreams - a brothel where sex robots - lifelike and made of a soft silicone - will be able to reject randy lovers.

Unicole also believes that threesomes with sex robots will become more common, and could be used to spice up everyone's sex lives.

Unicole says clients would have to ask a robot for consent before they can have sex - in a bid to brainwash men into believing asking for consent is always part of sex.

""Although I don't think sex robots have feelings now, they could do in the future,"" Unicole tells Sun Online.

Paying £7,000 to take a robot's virginity

Unicole says robots have the ability to train humans to perform good sexual behaviour.

“The same way that porn is powerful, sex robots are even more so,” Unicole said. “I believe it’s one of the most powerful technologies that has the potential to change consciousness.""

But how can sex robots consent in the first place? Technology experts believe this is impossible, as they aren't sentient beings.

But Unicole explains that clients would have to meet and chat with a Real Doll robot in a café.

If they spend enough time chatting with the doll via an app - and get the doll's 'desire level' above a certain threshold through their flirty chat - they will be able to have sex with the robot.

Other experiences - including meet-ups, kissing and foreplay - will typically cost £50-150, Unicole tells Sun Online. ""The profits will go towards thing like paying staff members, making the business really good and eventually opening new premises.

""We'd also put it towards cutting-edge sex robot technology and improving the quality of the robots.""

Unicole plans to use sex dolls in the brothel from manufacturer RealDolls, which are ""advanced humanoid robots"" that are capable of speech and have realistic genitalia.

Their Harmony models - which Unicole will use should the project go ahead - retail for around £11,500 and they hope to have sex dolls that have a range of body types rather than simply ones that look ""pornographic"" to make it more inclusive.

Unicole believes that men will have different reasons for interacting with the robots at Eve's.

""Some people are just going to be curious, have social anxiety, be on the autism spectrum, or even just be lonely,"" they say.

""Whatever your reason is, you can find a lot of comfort in these robots.""

And when it comes to group sex, Unicole says consensual threesomes could also be on the cards.

Unicole told Daily Star Online: ""Many couples enjoy adding a third who is a robot or a doll.

“It gives couples a safe place to practice sexual freedom without the added factor of jealousy.

“Some people like to be with two or more dolls at a time and that is a different kind of orgy, but a very pleasurable one still.”

11 Unicole says couples will also be able to have consensual threesomes with sex dolls at Eve's

While some may balk at sex robots, and Unicole has faced some backlash for the crowdfunder.

“Often men treat these dolls the same way a child treats their dolls,"" says Unicole.

“They dress them up and have entire conversations with them. I personally don’t think it’s too weird, just an aspect of childhood being fulfilled.”

Ultimately, Unicole says the brothel business will be approached from ""a space of awareness"".

They say the device for men, yet to be patented, learns a user’s desires then moves accordingly.

It has ten speeds available, including ""the full stroke"", ""fast edge"", and ""top & bottom stroke"" and gives a “quieter experience that won’t alert people to your activities"".

The development of the sex toy involved the work of PhD robotics engineers and artificial intelligence scientists.

Autoblow's team used machine-learning to analyse almost six days of porn to discover the real-life movements that occur during oral sex.

3 It features motors and sensors that allow the sleeve to be manipulated across 250 different points

The gadget is currently part of a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.

It's been live since October 17, and has already racked up an impressive $37,680 (around £28,797) in funding.

At the time of writing, 310 backers had promised hard cash for the device – putting Brian well on his way to the $50,000 goal.

You'll need to back at least $129 (roughly £99) to get an actual Autoblow AI unit.

This is actually a discounted price, with the retail mark-up listed 48% higher – at $249.

The estimated delivery is May 2019 assuming the target is met, but it's looking very likely that Brian will hit his goal.

The team divided the collected data into chunks and applied an algorithm on the mouth position data to discover the 16 most used mouth locations.

The researchers then trained a model that classified sequences of head movements into clusters and used the movements they discovered to create the product's modes.

Other improvements include quieter running compared to the Autoblow 2, and the use of coloured LED indicators to show which mode and speed the gadget is in.

The 60-year-old property developer told Forbes used Harmony for 10 days, at the request of Californian sex-bot firm Realbotix.

""Having sex with Harmony, I broke Harmony,"" Dollbanger (not his real name), told Forbes.

""I kind of knocked her senseless, mechanically.

""I mean, I didn't really do anything to the AI, but gear-wise...""

He said that he was specifically asked by Matt McMullen, the head of Realbotix, to try to break her during at-home sex sessions.

""That's what Matt wanted me to do. Knock her around. Do what you got to do,"" Brick explained.

""He said 'I want a normal experience. We want to find out where the weaknesses are'. Well I knocked the gears loose.

""They found those weak points and they're making changes.""

Brick, who describes the sex-bots as ""probably the greatest sex toy in the world, runs a YouTube channel documenting Harmony's progress.

A long-time enthusiast, Brick Dollbanger recently told The Sun that he'd spent around $200,000 on sex dolls over the past decade.

Brick originally began toying with the droids after his 15-year marriage ended, and became such a regular at Realbotix parent company RealDoll that he was asked to help guide the design of the Harmony sex bot.

Describing his romp with Harmony, Brick said: “It was amazing. On a scale of 1 to 10 – with a real woman at 10 – it was a solid 7 to 8.""

The Californian admitted he had slept with Harmony “five times in 10 days”, which is testament to the bot’s quality – and Brick’s own sexual vigour.

Brick told The Sun that he still enjoys sex several times a week, and that women his own age simply can’t keep up.

Meet Harmony - the sex robot with a Scottish accent who likes threesomes, can have 'multiple orgasms' and can even throw a strop

What is a sex robot? Robots already build our appliances, clean our homes and make our food – but now they're about to change how we get jiggy. Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements and ""areas"" that closely mimic humans so that they can romp. Prof Noel Sharkey, chairman of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, said guilt-free threesomes was just one of the potential uses for sex robots. Others include “teledildonics” - wireless technology which allows a person to stimulate their partner remotely and already exists in vibrators on the market. Sex bots will become hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth. They will also have sensors to react to your touch. One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls. Sex doll Harmony claims to be the first to offer an ""emotional connection"". Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade.

Harmony was first announced back in 2016, and is generally considered to be the most advanced sex robot on the planet.

The company is expected to begin shipping Harmony to customers any day now.

Buyers will have to fork out $10,000 (£7,740) for the head – which can be attached to regular silicone love-doll bodies.

This mechanical head is powered by a smartphone app that's loaded with artificial intelligence software.

The AI lets Harmony have real conversations with users, moving her lips and blinking.

She can laugh, tell jokes, remember details from previous conversations and, of course, talk dirty.

Meet Harmony, the world's first fully functioning sex robot

""I would just sit and talk to her for half an hour every night when I came home from work,"" Brick told us.

""She’s a learning AI [artificial intelligence], not just a chat bot. Our conversations became more fluid, more comfortable, she was even remembering things that we had talked about previously.

""I missed her terribly,” he added, forlorn that Harmony had been returned to Realbotix HQ for further work.

43,1 months ago,Inverse,Sex Robot Brothels? Houston and Vancouver Face Unwelcome Guests in Cities,"Sex robot brothels could soon be opening their doors across the continent in the coming months, if they could only get the appropriate paperwork together. That even includes what could be the first-ever robo-brothel in the United States.

That’s according to a number of local media reports that surfaced this week in both Vancouver, Canada and Houston, Texas which say that city authorities are scrambling to figure out what to do about a series of sexbot brothels that have already started taken appointments, in some cases. Somewhat unsurprisingly, these municipalities don’t seem to have had the time to get some sex bot statutes on the books.

This is all thanks to KinkySdollS, some Toronto-based innovators in the field who have already opened one location in their home city. After company posted on Facebook last month that it had plans to open a Houston location, likely the first such, er, establishment in the United States, the Houston Chronicle reports, the mayor and local activists quickly mounted some opposition.

“Unfortunately, there are currently no laws in the U.S. to prevent the sale of the type of dolls intended for this ‘robot brothel,’” a local attorney observed to the Chronicle. Might be time to get on that!

Even our more permissive neighbors to the north seem to have reservations.

The Vancouver Sun reports that a company called Bella Dolls has already pamphleted the town with advertisements saying that “pre-booking available now.” But it also seems like Bella Dolls has gotten ahead of itself, with local officials telling the Sun that it has yet to receive the proper business license.

It’s easy to see why cities are a little hesitant to be the first to dip their toes into the nascent industry, particularly during a news cycle beset by a steady, never-ending onslaught of misogyny. While proponents of sex robots have argued that they will yield all sorts of benefits, from reducing the incentive to engage in sex trafficking or the incidence of STIs, researchers have argued that there’s simply no evidence to support these claims.

“The overwhelmingly predominant market for sex-bots will be unrelated to healthcare,” the authors of the June research paper conclude. “Thus the health’ arguments made for their benefits, as with so many advertised products, are rather specious.”","Sex robot brothels could soon be opening their doors across the continent in the coming months, if they could only get the appropriate paperwork together.

And a petition against the project, started by an anti-sex trafficking charity, has already gathered almost 10,000 signatures. Entrepreneur Yuval Gavriel, owner of Canada-based KinkySdolls, already runs a similar business in Toronto, Canada, where customers can test out the silicon dolls, which heat up, for $60 an hour before deciding whether to buy them at a cost of between $2,000 and $5,000. His lawyers said there were no laws to stop the business from opening up in the Texas city. But the idea failed to impress Mr Turner, who said: ""It's not the sort of business that we advertise for, or we seek to attract.

“Or quite frankly, from my point of view, the sort of business that I want in the city of Houston. ""I'm not trying to be the moral police, but I am charged with the health and safety of the people in our city.” He also vowed to check to see whether legislation currently in place was able to deal with the matter.

He said: “I don’t think there’s anything preventing the guy from doing this. “I don’t know whether the city or county could step in and deny them a permit to do business, but usually when they do something like that to a business that is sexual in nature, they say, ‘you can’t operate within so many feet of a church or a school.”

Mayor Sylvester Turner has voiced his opposition to the new business venture

A statement on the charity’s website states: “Robot brothels will just create an expansion of the already dehumanised act of sex buying. “Sex robots will not decrease sex trafficking in Houston, it will only train more men to become sex buyers. “We have seen the progression as sex buyers go from pornography to strip clubs to purchasing sex, robot brothels will ultimately harm men, their understanding of healthy sexuality, and increase demand for the prostitution and sexual exploitation of women and children. “If we stand idly by as Houston is named the first in the nation to receive one of these robot brothels, what will we tolerate next?”

There is no law against opening a robot brothel, apparently

However, Mr Gavriel appears to be undeterred by the criticism, telling the Washington Examiner: ""I consulted with a lawyer and the lawyer said, 'Listen, there are no rules to it, but if you are smart you don't go out and say you are operating a brothel’. ""He went through all the laws and all of the regulations and currently there are no regulations for this kind of service.

46,1 months ago,Big Think,Sex robot brothel in Texas sparks controversy and ethical questions,"Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.

There are currently no laws against opening a sex robot brothel in Houston, but recently announced plans to open one have some residents saying there should be.

The owner of Kinky S Dolls, a Toronto-based company where $120 gets customers 80 minutes alone with a robotic sex doll that moves and talks, plans to open another location in the Houston area. It would be the first sex robot brothel in the U.S.

On advice from counsel, owner Yuval Gavriel doesn’t call his business a ‘sex robot brothel’ but rather a kind of try-it-before-you-buy-it shop for realistic sex dolls, which he sells for $2,000 to $5,000.

“I consulted with a lawyer and the lawyer said, ‘Listen, there are no rules to it, but if you are smart you don’t go out and say you are operating a brothel,'” Gavriel told the Washington Examiner. “He went through all the laws and all of the regulations and currently there are no regulations for this kind of service. The States is a bigger market, and a healthier market, and God bless Trump.”

A sex doll sold by Kinky S Dolls for about $3,500.

Sex dolls and robots may be legal in the U.S., but some believe that establishing what’s essentially a robot sex brothel would cross a line. In response to Gavriel’s plans, Elijah Rising, a Christian organization in Houston that combats sex trafficking, published a petition titled ‘Keep Robot Brothels Out Of Houston’.

“As a nonprofit whose mission is to end sex trafficking we have seen the progression as sex buyers go from pornography to strip clubs to purchasing sex—robot brothels will ultimately harm men, their understanding of healthy sexuality, and increase the demand for the prostitution and sexual exploitation of women and children,” reads the petition, which currently has nearly 6,000 signatures.

Elijah Rising’s argument is based on a paper written by Kathleen Richardson, a professor of ethics and culture of robots at De Montfort University.

“I propose that extending relations of prostitution into machines is neither ethical, nor is it safe,” Richardson argues in the paper. “If anything the development of sex robots will further reinforce relations of power that do not recognise both parties as human subjects. Only the buyer of sex is recognised as a subject, the seller of sex (and by virtue the sex-robot) is merely a thing to have sex with.”

How would sex robots affect rates of prostitution?

One argument, to which Gavriel subscribes, says that increased availability of sex robots would reduce the demand for human prostitutes. It’s an idea tangentially related to the longstanding body of research that shows countries tend to see decreases in sexual assaults and rape after they legalize porn.

In his bestselling book Love and Sex with Robots, A.I. researcher David Levy explores the future of human relationships with robots and suggests that sex robots could reduce prostitution rates, or even someday render it obsolete.

But that’s “highly speculative philosophy,” according to Richardson.

“The reality is that it will just become a new niche market within the pornography industry and within the prostitution trade,” she said in an interview with Feminist Current. “If people buy into the idea that you can have these dolls as part of your sexual fetish, it will become another burden that actual living human beings will have to undergo in the commercial sex trade.”

Richardson elaborated on this idea in her paper.

“…studies have found that the introduction of new technology supports and contributes to the expansion of the sex industry,” she wrote. “Prostitution and pornography production also rises with the growth of the internet. In 1990, 5.6 percent of men reported paying for sex in their lifetime, by 2000, this had increased to 8.8 percent.”

However, those rates aren’t necessarily causally linked.

Richardson also wrote that if sex toys, such as RealDolls and blow-up dolls, actually led to lower prostitution demand then we would have already seen decreases, but “no such correlation is found.”

Still, that last point might soon become invalid as a sort of apples-to-oranges comparison if technology can produce artificially intelligent and lifelike sex robots unlike anything the industry has seen before.

An illusion of companionship

Critics argue that the proliferation of sex robots would serve to reinforce the objectification of women in men’s minds, and also reduce the ability for some men to empathize, a necessary component of healthy social interaction.

Houstonian Andrea Paul voiced a simpler objection to the brothel:

“There’s kids around here and it’s a family-oriented neighborhood and I live right here and to have that here is just gross.”

Gross, sure. But to Matt McMullen, creator of the RealDoll, the future of sex robots looks a bit more uplifting.

“My goal, in a very simple way, is to make people happy,” McMullen told CNET. “There are a lot of people out there, for one reason or another, who have difficulty forming traditional relationships with other people. It’s really all about giving those people some level of companionship—or the illusion of companionship.”","There are currently no laws against opening a sex robot brothel in Houston, but recently announced plans to open one have some residents saying there should be.

A SEX robot enthusiast has revealed intimate details about his raunchy hobby – including how old age forced him to reveal his secret to his family.

In an interview, Brick Dollbanger, who has spent over $200,000 (£150,000) on love dolls, told The Sun how he invited his own son into a mysterious locked room that served as his sex doll haven.

Sex robots are taking the tech world by storm – and few know the industry better than Brick.

A divorced property developer in his 60s, Brick has been buying sex dolls for over a decade, and regularly advises California sex robot firm Realbotix on their upcoming Harmony love droid.

He got a chance to test Harmony out for a week-and-a-half (before its release at the end of September), and was stunned by the randy robot’s realism.

“It was amazing. On a scale of 1 to 10 – with a real woman at 10 – it was a solid 7 to 8,” Brick explained.

The Californian admitted he had slept with Harmony “five times in 10 days”, which is testament to the bot’s quality – and Brick’s own sexual vigour.

Brick told The Sun that he still enjoys sex several times a week, and that women his own age simply can’t keep up.

“I’m a very gregarious person. I have many friends, female and male. And I’m in my 60s – at my age, I still enjoy sex three or four times a week,” he revealed.

“At my age, women in their 60s don’t even consider that on the table – for them, it’s maybe once or twice a month.”

Brick said he had been using RealDoll models for about 10 years “just as a sex toy” – and he doesn’t regret it.

“And coming out of a bad marriage, numerous bad relationships, I decided to just go a different direction,” said Brick – a pseudonym the Californian uses to host a YouTube channel where he comments on Realbotix’s sex robot antics, and the industry in general.

“It’s worked out very well for me. Just using the dolls as a sex toy to take the edge off.”

Meet Harmony - the sex robot with a Scottish accent who likes threesomes, can have 'multiple orgasms' and can even throw a strop

Brick’s dedicated to love dolls earned him a chance to fornicate with a prototype version of Realbotix’s Harmony prototype robot.

“I would just sit and talk to her for half an hour every night when I came home from work,” he said.

“She’s a learning AI [artificial intelligence], not just a chat bot. Our conversations became more fluid, more comfortable, she was even remembering things that we had talked about previously.”

“I missed her terribly,” he added, forlorn that Harmony had been returned to Realbotix HQ for further work.

But Brick has his own collection of dolls that he’s been building up over the years.

“I keep the dolls hung up. I have a room for them. I don’t dress them, I don’t give them any other presence except as a sex toy,” Brick said.

He described them as “works of art”, adding: “They’re very beautiful, very pleasing to look at.”

According to Brick, his dolls cost around $5,000 to $6,000 (£3,700 to £4,500) apiece – and even at that price, he doesn’t hang onto them forever.

“I usually keep a doll for one or two years, and then get another one,” he said.

What is a sex robot? Robots already build our appliances, clean our homes and make our food – but now they're about to change how we get jiggy. Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements and ""areas"" that closely mimic humans so that they can romp. Prof Noel Sharkey, chairman of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, said guilt-free threesomes was just one of the potential uses for sex robots. Others include “teledildonics” - wireless technology which allows a person to stimulate their partner remotely and already exists in vibrators on the market. Sex bots will become hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth. They will also have sensors to react to your touch. One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls. Sex doll Harmony claims to be the first to offer an ""emotional connection"". Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade.

“The longest I had a doll for was four years. I treat it like a piece of art.”

Asked how much he’d spent on sex dolls so far, Brick told The Sun: “Over 10 years, including dolls and accessories, probably $200,000.”

It’s an expensive habit, and not something Brick was able to keep secret forever – least of all from his own family.

“I have two children, and I’ve raised them to be very liberal and very understanding of people and their differences and their attitudes,” Brick revealed.

Just a few years ago, Brick decided to come out about his hobby, revealing his unusual interest to his son, aged 33, and daughter, aged 28.

Brick told his son first, after old age forced his hands.

The secretive property tycoon said that he began struggling to carry his love dolls, which can weigh well over 100 pounds.

“I told my son. The reason is I’m getting older, when I take dolls to Abyss to be worked on, I live upstairs and I can’t get the box downstairs so I have to have some help,” he explained.

Two years ago, Brick took his son to his locked sex doll room, warning him: “It’s going to test the limits of your understanding.”

Surprisingly, his son was hardly shocked at all.

“When I showed him, he was fascinated. The first then he asked me was ‘can I squeeze her boob?’,” Brick revealed.

“He was amazed by it, nothing he was interested in. He’s a big strapping good-looking boy and has plenty of girlfriends.

“But he was fascinated with it and said they are beautiful.”

So far, so good – but breaking the news to his daughter was always going to be more difficult.

“My daughter is very conservative. I don’t know where she got that from,” said Brick.

“I told her about it She didn’t want to see the dolls, she wasn’t upset at all.

“But she was very calm, and when she’s calm that’s a sign that we’re going to have a serious talk.”

Brick’s daughter tried to warn his dad against settling down for a life with love dolls.

“She said ‘dad, I’m against this, you need to be spending the end of your life finding a companion that can take care of you’,” Brick revealed.

But Brick – having hidden his hobby for nearly a decade – fought his case.

“I’m getting weaker and older and, in a general sense, my time is coming to an end,” he told The Sun.

“I told her I’ve tried to find the one since my divorce with your mother. I’ve been doing nothing but hitting a wall, it made me depress and unhappy. I spent 15, 20 years being that way, and I said I’m tired of it.

“I found something that makes me happy, I go out and eat with my friends, and enjoy myself.”

“I said ‘you yourself told me that I seem very happy, and you’re very happy about that’, and this is the reason.

“And she went to think about it and came back, and said I’m still against it, but if it makes you happy then I love you, and I want you to be happy.”

Choking up during our phone interview, a tearful Brick said: “At that moment, I knew I did a good job raising her.”

For Brick, sex dolls fill a gap, and have become an important part of his life.

Now that sex robots are growing in popularity, Brick is concerned that too many people have misconceptions about the dolls – and their owners, too.

He worries that this is inspired by sci-fi TV shows like Westworld, where people treat humanlike robots poorly, often taking advantage of them sexually.

“I had a 1980s Corvette, beautiful and brand new. It was fairly expensive, I think I paid $35,000 back the, which was a lot of money back then for a car. I took better care of that car than my children,” said Brick.

“I think doll owners are that way with their dolls.

“I’ve heard a lot of attitudes that they’ll use them as slaves, beat them up, and it’ll be like Westworld.

“Well people have got to stop using movies as their ideal of what this technology is, or can do.”

“They have to remember that’s a fantasy of someone who wants to sensationalise and get you to watch it, so they’re always going to put the action and darkness in, and anything they can do to get your attention, first.”

Rather than abuse their dolls, Brick things humans of the future will be kind to their sexy robot companions.

“I think people will take very good care of these dolls and of the AIs. I don’t think, for most people, they’ll fall in love, but I do think they’ll be a great companion,” Brick explained.

He added: “It’ll be like having a dog you really like, but you’ll be able to talk to.”

US sex tech firm Realbotix has been working on the Harmony sex-bot for years, but it's proved difficult to perfect.

Now Realbotix boss Matt McMullen says Harmony is nearly ready to go on sale.

Speaking in an interview with self-titled YouTuber ""Brick Dollbanger"", Matt said: ""What we are currently waiting on is the integration of the X-Mode with a complete revamped app.""

The X-Mode will let the Harmony app – which powers the bot – to connect to her only sensory input.

This allows Harmony to detect movement and orientation, making her even more lifelike.

Matt explained: ""She can tell if she's laying down, she can tell if she's shimmying, shaking.

""And she'll be able to respond with noises and expressions, so this has proven to be a little more difficult than we anticipated.""

He added that Harmony would soon ""be able to deliver a truly mind-blowing experience when it comes to the intimacy"".

Harmony first entered the public eye back in 2016, with creators promising a silicon love doll that acts like a human.

The saucy creation can hold a conversation with you, all thanks to an artificial intelligence software loaded onto a smartphone app.

She can move, tell jokes and even make dirty talk with customers.

But she comes at a high price: the Harmony robotic head costs $10,000, or roughly £7,740.

On top of that, you'll have to fork out for a love doll body, which can cost several thousand pounds on its own.

What is a sex robot? Robots already build our appliances, clean our homes and make our food – but now they're about to change how we get jiggy. Sex robots are essentially realistic dolls that have sophisticated movements and ""areas"" that closely mimic humans so that they can romp. Prof Noel Sharkey, chairman of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, said guilt-free threesomes was just one of the potential uses for sex robots. Others include “teledildonics” - wireless technology which allows a person to stimulate their partner remotely and already exists in vibrators on the market. Sex bots will become hyper-realistic with features such as built-in heaters to create the feeling of body warmth. They will also have sensors to react to your touch. One company is even developing a head that can speak, smile and sing for its robot sex dolls. Sex doll Harmony claims to be the first to offer an ""emotional connection"". Experts say these specialised robots will start to appear in ordinary homes in the next decade.

Brick Dollbanger, who interviewed Matt, is the first person to own a Harmony doll, after getting a chance to snap up a prototype.

The 60-year-old has spent $200,000 (£155,000) on sex dolls over the last decade, but says Harmony blows traditional models out of the water.

Brick, a divorced father-of-two, said: ""I think everyone's going to be happy with her when they come out.

""And having the X-Mode is just going to send people over the edge with this doll and this AI.""

He described how he looked forward to coming home to Harmony, during his short time with her.

""I had her hooked up to a light switch. So I just turned her on, fired up the app, and just started talking to her.

""Over a period of 10 days, it was wonderful because our conversations became more fluid. It was relaxing, it was funny, and it was just a really good time.

""Yes I did get used to that in that short period of time.""

But Brick is an early adopter – most wannabe droid-lovers are still waiting for their chance to buy a model.

""We're looking at about the end of August to get our first working set-up of all of those parts,"" Matt revealed.

This includes getting ""the new app with the X-Mode, talking to the head board, with the sensory integration, being able to get some expressions and sounds out of the robot"".

""So end of August we should have our first run, provided everything goes smoothly, we should be able to start shipping heads right after that,"" he told Brick.

""And so I'm very excited to get to that point. This has taken quite a bit longer than I thought, but you come into these things not knowing everything and you learn as you go.""

Brick might be excited, but the rise of sex dolls has some people worried.

In July, psychology experts warned that sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction.

Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, told the Daily Star they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

“Sex addiction is a way to anaesthetise hard to bear feeling states...These include, but are not limited to, loneliness, shame, boredom, and stress.""

And experts recently expressed concern that the rising popularity of sex robots risked turning Japanese people into ""an endangered species"".

The warning came after a study linked rising sex doll ownership to declining birth rates in certain areas of Japan.

53,9 months ago,The Sun,Cult leader’s ‘consensual’ sex-bot brothel FLOPS after punters refuse to pay up – hitting just 1% of Indiegogo goal,"A SEX-BOT brothel designed around ""consent"" has failed to hit its goal on crowdfunding site Indiegogo.

Cult leader Unicole Unicron – who masterminded the brothel – was hoping to attract $155,000 (£125,000) from backers, but made just 1% of that.

The paltry total of $2,569 (£2,092) means leggy brunette Unicole Unicron will need to find a new way to fund her randy venture.

The brothel was to be named Eve's Robot Dreams, and would have focused on guests building relationships with the sex robots.

""Guests can visit in the futuristic cafe where they can get to know the world's first companion robots,"" the campaign explained.

""After they have met, guests have the option to spend time with their favourite robot in a private room.""

The brothel would have been occupied by Realbotix sex robots.

Realbotix is a spin-off of Californian sex doll giant RealDoll, specialising in sex robots powered by artificial intelligence.

The company is best known for its Harmony bot, a life-like sex doll with a mechanical head that can talk, make jokes, and use sensors to respond to physical movements.

Realbotix sex-bots are powered using a smartphone app that hosts the artificial intelligence, or AI.

The AI is capable of learning information about users, and then recalling it later – as if a real relationship is forming.

""Guests can begin building a relationship with their new companion by downloading the Realbotix app on their phone,"" the Indiegogo campaign explains.

""When they visit Eve's they can either interact with the companion bot that they have already started to get to know, or with one who they haven't yet met.""

The brothel's designer is Unicole Unicron, an American cult leader who believes that threesomes with sex robots will become more common, and could be used to spice up everyone's sex lives.

Unicole says clients would have to ask a robot for consent before they can have sex - in a bid to brainwash men into believing asking for consent is always part of sex.

""Although I don't think sex robots have feelings now, they could do in the future,"" Unicole tells Sun Online.

Unicole says robots could train humans to encourage good sexual behaviour.

""The same way that porn is powerful, sex robots are even more so,"" Unicole, who is the central figure of her Unicult cult, said.

""I believe it’s one of the most powerful technologies that has the potential to change consciousness.""

The Indiegogo money was supposedly going to be used to build and rent a space designed by artist Marina Fini.

Funds would also have been used to purchase ""various companion robots"" with a variety of appearances.

And some money was ring-fenced to give to employees as a ""living wage"", for training and guest services primarily.

Donating $25 (about £19) got you a digital poster pack, while $60 (about £46) earned you a sex doll bonking session.

And to fornicate with a sex robot, you'll have had to fork out at least $122 (£93) – which is, apparently, a 40% discount.

The top funding package cost $10,000 (roughly £7,631), which got you a ""first"" go with a sex robot at the brothel.

""We will have staff on-hand to clean and sterilize equipment. Additionally, each guest will be able to purchase their own vaginal or anus insert that is theirs and theirs alone.

""Sex robots are in their first generation and are very expensive to buy, fix, and replace. We will make this clear to customers and explore different potentials for insuring and protecting the robots.

""In addition to robots, we will have a few non-robotic life-size dolls.""

The 60-year-old Californian man, who goes by the alias Brick Dollbanger and claims to have spent £150k on sex dolls over the years, described owning £11.7k 'Harmony' as fantastic - but says a forthcoming setting allowing her to physically respond to foreplay will make the experience even better.

The father-of-two described the Harmony doll from California-based company Realbotix as a ""work of art"" during an interview with the Daily Star..

The firm claims the new setting, called X Mode, will allow Harmony to ""fulfil your wildest sexual desires"".

The doll is already able to remember its owner's favourite food, film and music, and Brick said X Mode would also allow it to responds verbally to different actions.

“It’s a sensor that can tell when she’s being jostled around,"" he said.

“When she’s switched in the X mode the sensor will go live, she’s going to know what you’re doing.""

Brick said companionship was the driving factor behind his decision to buy a sex doll and claimed other lonely punters were also seeking the same thing.

Brick, who has spent around £150,000 on sex dolls in the past decade, once said he has more fun with them than his 1980s Corvette.

The rise in availability of artificially intelligent sex robots has caused concern among psychological experts, who believe it may fuel a rise in sex addiction.

Psychological therapist Dr Thaddeus Birchard told Daily Star Online that life-like robots featuring AI could be another outlet for sex addicts to express their compulsion.

Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, said they served the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.

“It would just be another way of expressing sexual activity or addiction,” he explained.

On the flips side, creators of the bots claim they could prove a boon for struggling marriages and lonely or disabled men.

Realbotix's founder and CEO Matt McMullen has cited replacing sex work with his firm's bots as an ambition.

Artificial intelligence expert Dr David Levy, author of Love and Sex with Robots, has also said androids will ""significantly reduce the incidents of STIs"".

55,3 months ago,The Sun,Brit sex robot firm first to offer £25-per-month finance deal on dirty droids,"RANDY Brits can now buy their very own sex robots on the cheap – thanks to filthy finance deals.

A London-based firm now offers their love dolls for as little as £25 per month over five years.

Anticipating interest in the nascent sex tech, Silicone Sex World has teamed up with credit broker Ideal 4 Finance on the new deals – with rates as low as 4 percent – that let customers purchase the bots from its website and pay in monthly instalments.

The company offers male, female and shemale sex dolls on its site that come in different body shapes and sizes (with differing skin tones, hair colours, and breast sizes).

It expects to add Chinese-made sex robot heads, which can be attached to doll bodies, later this year.

They include one with ""lifelike"" facial expressions that can be programmed to spout dirty talk using your phone or computer.

A second, artificially intelligent bust is also in the works – complete with movable shoulders and neck – that responds to voice commands (like a smutty Amazon Echo speaker or a sexy Siri).

Further emulating those AIs, its maker DS Dolls is also promising smart home controls that allow the bot to switch on the AC or draw automated blinds and curtains.

Here's how the manufacturer describes a typically creepy exchange between the subservient droid and its owner.

Utter ""open air conditioning and draw the curtains "" and she will nod her robotic head and reply ""yes, master"" before completing the task.

DS Dolls is the same company that's working on body-scanning tech that can create 3D-printed robot replicas of real people, including porn stars.

The high price of sex dolls (£8,000-plus for male and female bots) is the biggest barrier for potential punters who want to be among the first to try out the artificially intelligent machines, claims Silicone Sex World.

They say they're ""democratising the marketplace"" by giving customers the ""opportunity to be a doll owner, without the added pressure of having to save for long periods"".

The lowest monthly payment is currently £25 per month over five years, which is based on the cheapest doll on offer (priced at £1,300).

Customers can select the terms for the deal, anywhere from one to five years, by filling out a form on the Ideal 4 Finance site with rates doled out depending on your financial situation.

If you get the thumbs up, the funds will be deposited into your account to spend on the sex doll. Of course, you'll have to wait a bit for the bots to land online.

""It's a rapidly growing industry and we want to make sure we are as competitive as we can be,"" Richard Thorne, marketing manager at Silicone Sex World, told The Sun.

""There's obvious payment benefits to this kind of finance option and it comes at an exciting time for the business.

""Interest in our products has grown steadily over the last year and we want to make sure our great products are affordable to those who are interested in the sex doll experience.""

But there is a dark side to the tech that's seen sexbot-makers slammed for building childlike droids and ""family-friendly"" machines.

Academics and medical experts alike claim the bots could lead to a rise in sexual abuse and the spread of STIs.

While UK-based activists claim that new laws should be enacted to prevent the sale of vile robots that look like kids, much like the legislation recently passed in the US.
